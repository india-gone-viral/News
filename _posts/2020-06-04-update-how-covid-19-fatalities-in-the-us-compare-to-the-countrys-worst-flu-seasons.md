"When current estimates for COVID-19 are compared to the 1918 pandemic, they are eerily similar. The outcomes will likely be different given modern medicine," Lewis said. "However, the impact on society and its functioning is likely to be significant."</p><p>Lewis recently told AccuWeather, "Unfortunately, this thing has turned out the way I was afraid it might. Fortunately, the populace really stepped up and took some drastic measures that we in the pandemic preparedness field were never sure folks would actually do, such as closing schools, certain workplaces and having people stay at home.</p><p>"Plus, the level of mask wearing is surprising," Lewis added. "It all definitely helped us dodge a bullet in most places of the country, but now the unwinding is probably going to happen too quickly in some places and we'll see some spikes."</p><p>Looking ahead, Lewis has concerns about late summer and early fall.</p><p>"The weather angle may finally come to bear and help out a little here in the midst of summer," he said, "but I am concerned about how things will look in September."</p><p>There has been much speculation about how or to what extent summer in the Northern Hemisphere might affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most recently, Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health, said that <a data-ylk="slk:conclusive data will take months to gather and analyze" href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/health-wellness/summer-heat-alone-wont-stamp-out-coronavirus-nih-director-says/751952" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conclusive data will take months to gather and analyze</a>, but <a data-ylk="slk:short-term findings raise questions about a wished-for summer lull" href="https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/06/02/will-warm-weather-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short-term findings raise questions about a wished-for summer lull</a> in transmission.</p><p>"Those earlier studies focused on well-known human infectious diseases," Collins wrote. "Less clear is how seasonal variations in the weather might modulate the spread of a new virus that the vast majority of people and their immune systems have yet to encounter."</p><p>The concerns Dr. Lewis voiced about September and perhaps beyond were echoed in <a data-ylk="slk:a recent peer-reviewed study" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tbed.13631" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent peer-reviewed study</a> conducted in Sydney, Australia, that found <a data-ylk="slk:an association between lower humidity and an increase in coronavirus cases" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200601134608.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an association between lower humidity and an increase in coronavirus cases</a>, according to ScienceDaily.com.</p><p>"COVID-19 is likely to be a seasonal disease that recurs in periods of lower humidity," said one of the study's leaders, Professor Michael Ward, an epidemiologist in the Sydney School of Veterninary Science at the University of Sydney. "We need to be thinking if it's winter time, it could be COVID-19 time."</p><p>The 1918 influenza pandemic, sometimes called the Spanish Flu pandemic, was the most severe pandemic in recent history. An estimated 500 million people - or one-third of the world's population at the time - became infected, and <a data-ylk="slk:the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide</a>.
