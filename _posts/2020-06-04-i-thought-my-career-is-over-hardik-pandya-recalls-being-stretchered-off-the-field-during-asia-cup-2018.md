<p>Hardik Pandya's troubled back forced him to miss a number of series in 2018 and 2019. At first, he was ruled out of Asia Cup 2018 after being stretchered off the field in the game against Pakistan. Pandya further missed the West Indies series. In 2019, the back issue ruled him out of final international series before World Cup - three ODIs vs Australia. The troubled back also kept him out of the Caribbean tour following the ICC event. After the South Africa T20Is, in September, Pandya was once again ruled out.</p>

<p>In October 2019, he underwent back surgery and made his comeback to the national team for the three ODIs against South Africa (in March 2020). He is now fully fit and looks set to be part of the national team on a regular basis. However, there was a time when Pandya thought his career was over.</p>

<p>In a conversation with Harsha Bhogle on <em>Cricbuzz</em>, Pandya recalled the Asia Cup 2018, where he was stretchered off the field. The 26-year-old revealed that he had never seen someone being taken off the field on a stretcher, which raised doubts in his mind.</p>

<p>“I genuinely thought my career would be over because I have never seen someone walking off the ground in a stretcher. So when that happened and when I saw myself.....firstly, I was knocked out for 10 minutes. I was blacked out. I didn't know when I go inside. I just didn't know. That is why I asked people to go away. After that pain never went down,” he said.</p>

<p>The team management's decision to play Pandya in Asia Cup 2018 came as a big surprise as he was a part of the complete tour of England and Ireland and also played the one-off Test against Afghanistan. Although Pandya revealed that it was his final series and he was set to be rested after the multi-team event.</p>

<p>Pandya also talked about Test cricket and said that it is a challenge for him to play the longest format right now. Pandya's previous Test appearance came against England in 2018. He returned to the Test squad for the final two Tests against Australia in 2018/19 but wasn't included in the playing XI. </p>
