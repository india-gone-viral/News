					Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald is sending out a warning as the county prepares to move into the green phase of Governor Tom Wolf’s reopening plan early Friday morning.“The virus has not gone away,” Fitzgerald said at a news conference on Wednesday. “We have not developed a vaccine or a cure to this point. So we really want people to make sure they remain safe.” The green phase of the Governor’s reopening plan has reduced mitigation efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic but still includes several recommendations to curb the spread of the illness.“As we go into the green phase, we still want people to work remotely if they can,” said Fitzgerald. “Work at home. Physical distancing. Because we know wearing a mask, keeping physical distance and being not in an enclosed space with a lot of people is your best chance to avoid being infected by the virus.”Nearly all of southwestern Pennsylvania will move in the green phase at 12:01 a.m. Friday.The only local county that will not advance to that phase is Beaver County, which will remain in the yellow phase.
