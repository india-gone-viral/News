<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">If you were to compile a manual stating what every Indian should know before investing, you would know the daunting task that it actually is. Investments, particularly those made in the stock market, are often intimidating for a regular investor or layman, owing to perceptions of risk, losses, and lack of knowledge about how markets function. </span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">However, if you do a little research and venture online, you will find everything you wanted to know about stock market investing. Some people may find it easy to deploy their investments across various stocks and shares although it can really be tough if you wish to achieve success in the future. Most retail investors, i.e. those who are not professional investors or stock market players, end up losing their money almost every year. This is because they do not have ample time to conduct research on a huge number of stocks and there is no research professional or team engaged to help them track, understand, and follow stocks accordingly. If you are thinking to move steadily in the stock market, you can consider investing in Public sector undertaking companies like Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). Hence, before you check up on the </span></span><a href="https://groww.in/stocks/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><u><b>BPCL share price</b></u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> or likewise, understand that a little homework is a must if you are to be a successful investor. </span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>5 top things to know about each stock that you are looking to purchase</b></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">There are some </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>basic things to know before investing in shares </b></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">and these are applicable for purchasing stocks individually as well. Hereâ€™s taking a look at the top 5 essentials that are a must for stock purchases: </span></span></p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>What the company actually does</b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">- </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>What to know before buying stocks </b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">is what the company in question does, i.e. what they produce/manufacture, what services they provide, where do they function, what are their flagship offerings and how are their products/services selling. Know about their market position and whether they have any leadership in their industry. This information can be readily found online. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Price to Earnings or P/E Ratio</b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">- One of the </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>key factors to consider when buying a stock </b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">is the P/E ratio. This ratio can be worked out by dividing the market value of any company for each share by its overall earnings (per share). Suppose the P/E ratio of an organization is 15; this may indicate that investors in the market can readily pay INR 15 for each INR 1 that is earned by the company. This may seem costly at first although it may be quite reasonable if the company is witnessing rapid growth and has excellent future prospects. You can find this ratio by comparing the cumulative company earnings over the last 4 quarters with the present market price. The higher P/E ratio should be justified properly. If a company has a lower ratio but is witnessing fast growth, this may well be a good investment option. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Beta- </b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">This term should be carefully understood before you contemplate the share price of renowned public undertaking organizations like </span></span></span><a href="https://groww.in/stocks/beml-ltd"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><u><b>BEML share price</b></u></span></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> or prices of other company shares. This term helps in analyzing volatility or the performance of the stock of the company over a period of 5 years. This measures the basic risks for a stock of a particular company in comparison to the whole market. This value is readily available like the P/E ratio as well. If the company has a steep rise or fall in value over the last 5 years, the beta will be higher. Anything that is more than one is perceived as truly </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><i>high</i></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> in this case. This automatically equates to greater risk levels and anything which is lesser than one means lower risk levels or </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><i>low</i></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> beta. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Dividends- </b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">These are similar to interest paid out through a savings account, where you are paid irrespective of the price of the stock in the market. These are distributions allotted to shareholders by companies as rewards from their profits. The board of directors at companies usually decides on dividend amounts and these mostly come in the form of cash or shares alike. Dividends help investors in earning steady income at periodic intervals, majorly on a quarterly basis. Investing in stocks </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">that</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> have higher dividends could be a smarter thing to do at times. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Charts- </b></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">There are various kinds of charts which are used in the market. These may </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">comprise line</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> charts, candlestick varieties and even line charts. The charts in question are majorly used by technical and fundamental analysts. Reading the same will not always be an easy task and could have specific complications. You will have to invest a little time </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">in</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"> reading your charts carefully, particularly if you are a retail investor. Suppose your chart starts downwards, then you should steer clear while if it starts at the bottom on the left and rises towards concluding at the upper right portion, then things look good. </span></span></span></p>
