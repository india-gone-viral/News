  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-a6b1a83cca8f2e6049c0c00baf31aff7"><p><strong>Vince Johnson</strong> of The Vince Johnson Band -- who made up one half of the music duo who wrote and performed Joe's tracks featured on the Netflix series -- just inked an exclusive licensing and distribution deal with BMG Rights Management and Create Music Group.</p>

  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-8cfc417859bf160f88bb054b2aac9837"><p>As part of the agreement, all those Joe tunes (which are actually Vince's) will be compiled onto an album for the first time and be released on streaming services everywhere in the coming months. There'll also be some new tunes, including a cut called 'Killer Carole.' Probably won't be a big hit in <strong>Carole Baskin</strong>'s crib.</p>
  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-f151fd71af2458c2984df5bb6ba2f8f8"><p>We got a little taste of this gem before it officially drops Friday -- we're thinking you can add this one to your back road country playlist. No sign of Joe, though, in the pseudo-music video -- he's a little <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/30/tiger-king-joe-exotic-prison-fort-worth-coronavirus-rate-federal-response/"><strong>tied up right now</strong></a>, unfortunately.</p>

  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-dfa3ba83e17b420977c82cf009d70247"><p>In any case, it's great news for Vince and co. ... whom, as we previously told you, were gunning for a record deal of some sort in the wake of the show's massive popularity. Unclear if they've gotten signed to a label yet, but a licensing deal is kinda like getting halfway there.</p>
  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-149a70f8f741003bb82c2ed7a70d624d"><p>Of course, Vince lost his longtime music collaborator -- <strong>Daniel Clinton</strong> -- who helped him pen a lot of the songs on 'Tiger King,' after <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/03/29/joe-exotic-band-tiger-king-song-clinton-johnson-record-deal/"><strong>he passed away</strong></a> from a heart attack late last year. Here's hoping Vince does him proud with this streak of good luck going forward.</p>
