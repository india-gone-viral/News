Some think it is great, some think it is reckless. Regardless of where each of us falls on that spectrum, we will go through it as a community," he wrote.</p><figure><span>

        </figure><p>Political rallies are a source of inspiration as well as invigoration for Donald Trump. He draws energy from arenas filled with enthusiastic supporters, and uses their responses to the various riffs in his sometimes long, free-form speeches to sense what issues resonate with his loyal base.</p><p>For more than three months, as Covid-19 has spread across the US, the president has had to do without these emotional and strategic sounding boards. Now, the rallies are coming back, even though cases of the virus are reaching new record peaks in many states and public health officials continue to warn of the dangers of large gatherings.</p><p>With less than five months until election day, the president is billing this as the beginning of his re-election bid. Given that he held his official campaign kick-off in Orlando almost exactly a year ago, it perhaps is better seen as a re-boot of a campaign that has struggled to gain its footing as the nation has been beset by the pandemic and mass demonstrations against institutional racism and excessive force by police. </p><p>The president is now billing his campaign around the slogan "the Great American Comeback". Given the recent turmoil, and Mr Trump's sagging poll numbers, he is clearly hoping the Tulsa rally is the beginning of his own political revival.</p><figure><span>

        </figure><p>There are also concerns among officials in Tulsa that there will be clashes between supporters and opponents of the president. </p><p>Emotions are still running high following the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis last month, which sparked widespread anti-racism protests.</p><figure><span>

It will be a much different scene!"</p><p>Mr Trump had planned to hold the rally on Friday.
