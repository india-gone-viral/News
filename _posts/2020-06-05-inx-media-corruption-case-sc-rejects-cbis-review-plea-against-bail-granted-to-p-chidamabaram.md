We have perused the review petition and the connected papers carefully and are convinced that the order, of which review has been sought, does not suffer from any error apparent warranting its reconsideration," the bench, also comprising justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, said. <br></br>"The review petition is, accordingly, dismissed," the bench said in its June 2 order which was uploaded on the apex court website today (Thursday). <br></br>Chidambaram was arrested by the CBI on August 21 last year in the corruption case which was registered on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the </p><p>INX Media</p><p> group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007, during his tenure as finance minister. <br></br>Chidambaram has denied all the allegations levelled against him in the case. <br></br></p></div>
