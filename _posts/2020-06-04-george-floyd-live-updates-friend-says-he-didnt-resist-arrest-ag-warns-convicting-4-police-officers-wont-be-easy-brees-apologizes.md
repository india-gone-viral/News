Meghan, who is biracial, has been vocal in the past about enduring racist incidents in Hollywood as an actress and in tabloids as a member of the British royal family. She lamented the fact that the past felt like it was repeating itself and students again had to face strife as a reality, rather than a "history lesson."</p><p>"The first thing I want to say to you is that I'm sorry," she said.

The steps, he said, include reviewing their law enforcement's use-of-force policies with community members, and committing to report on any needed changes. Obama said his administration created a task force in 2014 after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that produced many reforms. </p><p>Obama also supported protesters demanding police reforms and justice for Floyd. “We both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable, but we also have to translate that into practical solutions and laws that could be implemented and monitored and make sure we’re following up on.”</p><h2>More news about the George Floyd protests</h2><ul><li><strong>Ben & Jerry's weigh in:</strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/03/ben-jerrys-calls-for-dismantling-white-supremacy/3137898001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ice cream company calls out white supremacy.</a></li><li><strong>'Law and order': </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/02/george-floyd-trump-returns-law-and-order-theme-rose-garden/5310231002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Trump returns to 2016 theme as violence spreads after George Floyd death</a>.</li><li><strong>Resources, ways to donate:</strong> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/05/29/george-floyd-death-donations-resources-justice-petitions/5282539002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How you can take action from home after the death of George Floyd</a>.</li><li><strong>Covering Floyd protests:</strong> Journalists blinded, injured, arrested.</li></ul><h2>'Unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer' in NYC</h2><p>A day that began with hope that New York City was beginning to find a way out of the crisis caused by the coronavirus and a week of angry demonstrations over police brutality ended Wednesday with more violence.</p><p>Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd drew thousands of people in New Yotk City, but police broke them up after shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew.
