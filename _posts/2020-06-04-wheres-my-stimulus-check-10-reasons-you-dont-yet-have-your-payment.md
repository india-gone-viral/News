            </p>
            <p>Is there a reason you haven't received your <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/coronavirus-stimulus-questions-answered-requirements-schedule-prepaid-card/">stimulus check</a></span> from the IRS? The agency has now made 159 million payments to Americans who meet the qualifications, the IRS told CNET. But if you're still waiting, we uncovered several obstacles that could cause a delay. For example, your check could be scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks or later this year, or there may be a banking issue you'll need to help work out.</p><p>For some, <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/stimulus-check-tracking-tool-still-not-working-for-you-here-are-11-possible-reasons-why/">finding the status of their payments has been frustrating</a></span>, as many CNET readers have shared. From checks either missing in <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://disq.us/p/29cdh31" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mail</a> or <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://disq.us/p/29bwtv8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bank accounts</a>, some believe <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/what-do-i-do-if-my-economic-stimulus-check-never-comes/">their payments have fallen through the cracks</a></span>. </p><p>Before we begin, it's also important to know <em>where</em> to look for the money. Your stimulus payment could arrive through direct deposit to your bank account, if you had <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/its-too-late-to-direct-deposit-your-stimulus-check-heres-what-happens-now/">set that up before the May 13 deadline</a></span>. At this point, however, it's more likely you'll get it in the mail, either as a paper check or as a <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/coronavirus-stimulus-questions-answered-requirements-schedule-prepaid-card/">prepaid debit card</a></span>. </p><p>Either way, the stimulus money is <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/28-tricks-to-stretch-your-stimulus-check-and-save-money-during-quarantine/">yours to spend</a></span> however you like. (A bill for a <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/is-a-second-stimulus-check-coming-the-update-on-another-round-of-1200-payments/">second round of stimulus checks for up to $1,200</a></span> is up for debate in Congress.)</p><div data-track="newsletter" section="subscribeNewsletter">

    <h2>The IRS has scheduled your payment for later in the year</h2><p>While the IRS had sent out 159 million payments as of June 3, it still has more to go. In April, the <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/2020.04.16%20Rebate%20Payment%20Timeline%20FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IRS estimated</a> (PDF) it could take up to 20 weeks to send every payment out and it is prioritizing the payment schedule by sending checks to those with lowest incomes first. Depending on your adjusted gross income, you may have weeks and possibly several months to wait, according to the IRS plan.</p>

    <h2>The IRS was waiting for your banking info before sending your check<br></br></h2><p>The IRS made a big push to get everyone who was eligible for a check <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/you-missed-the-irs-stimulus-direct-deposit-deadline-dont-worry-heres-what-happens/">signed up for direct deposit by May 13</a></span>.  The benefit of direct deposit, the IRS said, was you'd get your check  quicker than through the mail. Now that the deadline is passed, the IRS  said it will start sending paper checks and debit cards to those it  doesn't have banking information for through June.</p><h2>Your bank had trouble processing the direct deposit</h2><p>If your bank couldn't process the electronic money transfer from the IRS, the payment was returned and the IRS is now mailing your check to the most current address it has on file, either from a 2019 or 2018 tax return or one from the Postal Service.</p><h2>A claimed dependent is not eligible for a payment</h2><p>Parents who  are not married to each other and do not file a joint return cannot  both claim a qualifying child as a dependent. The parent who claimed  their child on their 2019 return may receive the payment. Likewise,  dependent college students do not qualify for a payment.</p><h2>You owe child support<br></br></h2><p>If you are past-due on child support, the IRS said your payment may be reduced or completely deducted. If that happens, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will send you a notice.</p><h2>You may have been scammed<br></br></h2><p>The FBI warns that scammers are looking to steal your stimulus check.

If you receive a letter from the IRS notifying you that the agency has already sent your money -- with details on whether it came through the mail or straight to your bank -- but you didn't get the payment, the letter includes information on how to report that the money didn't arrive. </p><h2>You need to file a nonfilers form</h2><p>If you are eligible for a payment but because of low income didn't need to file a tax return for 2018 or 2019, you may need to use the IRS' nonfilers tool to give the agency your information. If you think that is you, <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">head to the IRS' website</a>, check the requirements and then provide some basic information to get your stimulus check.</p><p>To assist you with potential problems regarding your payment, <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-adds-phone-operators-to-answer-economic-impact-payment-questions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the IRS added 3,500 telephone representatives</a> to help navigate common issues.
