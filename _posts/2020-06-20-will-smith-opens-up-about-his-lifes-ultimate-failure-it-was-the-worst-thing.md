I’ve been hurt a lot in my adult life, but I don’t think anything touches the failure of getting divorced from my 2-year-old son’s mother.”</p><p>Smith shared a three-year marriage with Zampino from 1992 to 1995, and over the course of their union, the pair welcomed their son Trey, now 27, in 1992.</p><p>In November 2018, the two-time Oscar nominee revealed in a heartfelt <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqsdyB3hwzL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram video</a> that he and his oldest son Trey "struggled for years" after the "Men in Black" star divorced Zampino.</p><p>Two years after spitting from Zampino, Smith married Pinkett Smith in 1997 after the pair developed a romantic connection outside of acting. They have since welcomed son Jaden, 21, and daughter Willow, 19.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jada-pinkett-smith-supporting-husband-will-smith-career" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>JADA PINKETT SMITH 'LOST' HERSELF IN SUPPORTING HUSBAND WILL SMITH'S CAREER, MOM SAYS</strong></a></p><p>Zampino herself has also spoken out in confidence about the blended family she shares with Smith and company, and in a May 2018 episode of the popular Facebook Watch program, the actress sat with Pinkett Smith and discussed the transition that ultimately brought the entire family closer.</p><p>"Do you remember that conversation we had on the phone that one time?" Pinkett Smith pressed to Fletcher.
