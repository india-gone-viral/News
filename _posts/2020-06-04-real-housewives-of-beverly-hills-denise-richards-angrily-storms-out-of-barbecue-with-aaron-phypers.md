'All we said, it's so simple: ''Our kids, they're teenagers. Just please know that they're right there and they can hear you. Know your surroundings. That's it''.'</p><div>  <p>Broke bread: 'Everyone came over to our home, we shared bread with you,'  Aaron reminded the women</p></div><p>'You're making an issue out of nothing,' he continued, as Teddi sputtered.</p><p>Lisa asked Denise what Sami had said to her about the threesome conversation, to which Denise replied, 'That's between me and Sami.'</p><p>In a flashback, Sami was shown brushing it all off and declaring the threesome talk 'hilarious.'</p><div>  <p>Good question: Lisa asked Denise what Sami had said to her about the threesome conversation, to which Denise replied, 'That's between me and Sami'</p></div><p>'They're gonna talk about this stuff, they're gonna go to Google and be even more curious about it,' Aaron explained to the cast.

It's ridiculous.'</p><p>'I feel amazing, 'cause I don't care!' Erika said, standing up and walking away.</p><div>  <p>Moving on: 'I feel amazing, 'cause I don't care!' Erika said, standing up and walking away</p></div><p>In a confessional, Teddi asked, 'Really big guy? Does this make you feel good? Do you feel powerful? Do you feel strong? Oh yeah, it's so sexy when you put women down. A**hole.'</p><p>Dorit Kemsley, 43, told Garcelle that Denise's refusal to bring her children to the barbecue made the rest of them look bad, because their children were there.</p><p>Kyle called it 'passive-aggressive mom-shaming,' and Aaron said, 'Passive-aggressive. Please define it for me… who are you talking about?

You are a f***ing s*** stirrer.'</p><p>Teddi suggested that Denise was obviously not okay with the way things had gone in Santa Barbara, because she shut the conversation down, and Denise agreed she'd been tired of it.</p><p>'What did my movies have to do with conversations with my daughter?'
