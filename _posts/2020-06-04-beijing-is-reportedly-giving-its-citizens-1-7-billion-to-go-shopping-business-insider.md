<p>Citizens of Beijing are set to have a government-funded shopping spree as the city hands out 12.2 billion yuan, or $1.7 billion USD, in vouchers, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/beijing-to-give-1-7-billion-in-vouchers-to-boost-shopping?srnd=premium&sref=Bq9vyGd4">according to a report from Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>In addition to shopping, the vouchers can be used for catering, tourism, education, and sports, the report said. </p><p>The vouchers come as China seeks to recover from the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Retail sales <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-sales-china-coronavirus-crisis-2020-3">fell by over 20% earlier this year</a> due to the shutdowns. </p><p>As the first country hit by the coronavirus, which originated there, China has also had a head start in its economic recovery from the shutdowns. China's <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/china-economy-bounces-back-rest-of-world-recovering-pmi-surveys-2020-6-1029277271">economy bounced back in May</a>, as other countries around the world are just starting to recover. </p>



<p>Beijing is not alone in handing out the vouchers — over 50 cities across China are offering similar handouts, according to the report, including Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. </p>
