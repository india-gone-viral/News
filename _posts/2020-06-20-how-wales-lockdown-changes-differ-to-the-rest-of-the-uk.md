</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wales:</strong> Two households can meet one another, and there are no restrictions on how many people this can involve. </p> <p>However, it must still be done outdoors with social distancing measures in place. People must also "stay local" and remain within five miles of their homes. The only exception to travelling beyond that distance to see loved ones is on "compassionate grounds".</p> <p><strong>England:</strong> Up to six people from different households can meet outdoors providing they adhere to social distancing. </p> <p>On Saturday, June 13 it was announced that people who live alone - or single parents with dependent children - can form a "bubble" and meet indoors with one other household.</p> <p><strong>Scotland:</strong> People from one household can meet with people from up to two other households outdoors. </p> <p>While these do not always have to be the same households, the Scottish Government's advice is that people should not meet more than two other households in one day.</p> <p>Similarly, those who live alone - or single parents with children under 18 - can now form an "extended household" and meet indoors with one other household.</p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Similarly to England, up to six people from different households can meet outdoors providing they adhere to social distancing. </p> <p>On Saturday, June 13 it was announced that people who live alone can form a "small support unit" with one other household and meet indoors.</p> <h4>Non-essential shops</h4> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/article18449630.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_254152717.jpg" itemprop="url"></meta><meta content="615" itemprop="width"></meta><meta content="365" itemprop="height"></meta><div>

</figure><p><strong>Wales:</strong> All non-essential retail can now open in Wales from Monday, June 22 providing they have measures in place to comply with two-metre social distancing. </p> <p>First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to make preparations to resume services by appointment only. Garden centres were allowed to open their doors from June 1.</p> <p><strong>England:</strong> On Monday, June 15 non-essential shops in England were allowed to reopen providing social distancing measures were in place. </p> <p>It led to scores of shoppers queuing outside some of the country's biggest high street chains such as Primark and Sports Direct.</p> <p>Garden centres reopened on May 13.</p>  <p><strong>Scotland:</strong> Most shops in Scotland are due to reopen from Monday, June 29 - the most cautious approach of any UK nation. </p> <p>However, indoor shopping centres will remain closed except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists.</p> <p>Garden centres were allowed to reopen on May 29.</p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Non-food retail outlets were allowed to open with a lower frequency of customers from Monday, June 8. </p> <p>The least cautious UK nation in this regard has also announced that it will allow hairdressers to open on Monday, July 6.</p> <p>Garden centres were allowed to reopen on May 18.</p> <h4>Travel</h4> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article18443488.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS179393318.jpg" itemprop="url"></meta><meta content="615" itemprop="width"></meta><meta content="359" itemprop="height"></meta><div>

</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wales:</strong> For at least the next two weeks, people in Wales are being told to "stay local" with a five-mile "rule of thumb" in place. </p> <p>However, this restriction will be lifted on Monday, July 6 "if conditions allow". It means from that date people are likely to be able to visit holiday destinations across Wales, as well as see family members outdoors outside their own localities.</p> <p><strong>England:</strong> There are no restrictions on how far people can travel in England. </p> <p><strong>Scotland:</strong> Similar to Wales, as a guide people are asked to stay within five miles of their home. However, that limit does not apply to meeting family and friends. </p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> There are no restrictions on how far people can travel. </p> <section data-ad-dockable="true" data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2"></section><h4>Schools</h4> <p><strong>Wales:</strong> Schools are set to reopen on Monday, June 29 but only a third of pupils will be allowed in at any one time. The term will be extended by one week to end on July 27 to give children and staff time to catch up before the summer break. The autumn half term in October will be extended from one week to two. </p> <p><strong>England:</strong> England began a phased reopening of primary schools on June 1, welcoming children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6. There had been an aim for all primary pupils to spend four weeks in school before the summer break, but that has now been scrapped. Some year 10 and 12 pupils have now returned to secondary schools and colleges. </p> <p><strong>Scotland:</strong> Schools are preparing to reopen under a "blended model" of at-school and at-home learning on August 11. </p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Pupils in key year groups such as years 7, 12 and 14 will return to school on August 24. The rest of the school population will go back to class at the start of September. </p> <h4>Public amenities</h4> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article18290898.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_bessemer.jpg" itemprop="url"></meta><meta content="615" itemprop="width"></meta><meta content="409" itemprop="height"></meta><div>
