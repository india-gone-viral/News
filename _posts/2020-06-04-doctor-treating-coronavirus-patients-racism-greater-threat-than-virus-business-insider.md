</figure></p><p>As an emergency-medicine doctor, I find myself gifted with a rare vantage point at the crossroads of healthcare and humanity. A chance to work in a department that, within its walls of dizzying activity, reflects the world outside the hospital — one in the throes of a virus that does not discriminate.</p>



<p>A virus that does not discriminate but nevertheless operates in a world that does.</p><p>A world with unequal access to sanitation, inequitable housing practices, and extreme wealth gaps that force our most vulnerable to shelter together when they cannot make rent.</p><p>A nondiscriminatory virus made to be unjust because of the world it operates in is an analogy for health disparities as a whole. Biology that is the same manifesting unjustly — not because of the biology itself, but because of the world in which that biology resides.</p><p>Now, with millions of Americans marching in protest of Black injustice during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely inevitable that in a few short weeks I will again hear repeated cries in the emergency department of "I can't breathe" as COVID-19 once again affects Black communities disproportionately.</p>



<p>And yet, as a Brown man with relative privilege, I stand with the protesters in absolute solidarity. I must, because the virus is just a problem, not <em>the </em>problem.</p><p>Racism — unless put in the spotlight, unless called out, rectified, and abolished — will always be a greater threat to justice than a virus. A post-virus America would nevertheless remain sick.</p><p>Yes, wear a mask. Yes, wash your hands. Yes, do your best to maintain distance. And yes, absolutely yes, join your allies to abolish injustice. </p><p>We all breathe the same air, but some of us breathe more freely.</p>
