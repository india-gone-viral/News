<p>India was elected unopposed as one of the non-permanent member of the UNSC after winning 184 votes in the 193-member General Assembly. The minimum requirement to get elected was 128 votes.</p>
<p>India has served seven times earlier as non-permanent member of the UNSC in 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and 2011-2012.</p>
<p>“We have received overwhelming support and we we deeply humbled by the tremendous confidence that the member states of the United Nations have reposed in India,” T S Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative to the UN said in a video-recorded message.</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">Member States elect India to the non-permanent seat of the Security Council for the term 2021-22 with overwhelming support.</p>
<p>India gets 184 out of the 192 valid votes polled. <a href="https://t.co/Vd43CN41cY">pic.twitter.com/Vd43CN41cY</a></p>
<p>— India at UN, NY (@IndiaUNNewYork) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiaUNNewYork/status/1273346981650456576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p>“India will become a member of the United Nations Security Council at a critical juncture and we are confident than in the Covid- and the post-Covid world India will continue to provide leadership and a new orientation for a reformed multilateral system,” he added.</p>
<p>India was elected unopposed as it was the only candidate in the Asia-Pacific Group (APG). India has returned to the UNSC after a decade starting January 2021. The last time India served at the UNSC was between 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>India's election to the UNSC was endorsed in June 2019 by the APG after Afghanistan gave up its seat for India.</p>
<p>The election was held at the UN headquarters in New York which opened for the first time since March 15 due to coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Along with India, Ireland, Mexico and Norway also won the UNSC elections held on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The UNSC has 15 members, includin five permanent members - the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. The 10 other members are non-permanent and half of them are elected every year, each for a two-year term, starting January 1.</p>
