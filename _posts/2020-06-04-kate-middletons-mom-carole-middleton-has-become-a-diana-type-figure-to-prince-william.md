<p><a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kate-middleton/">Kate Middleton’s</a> mother, Carole Middleton, has more influence on the royal family than previously thought. Royal watchers have always known that Kate, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-kate-middleton-saved-her-relationship-with-prince-william-before-she-became-the-duchess-of-cambridge.html/">Duchess of Cambridge</a>, is very close to her mother, and one royal expert argues that Carole also has a tight-knit relationship with her husband, Prince William. The two have grown so close over the years that Carole has been described as a “Diana-type” mother to William, much to the chagrin of his father, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/queen-elizabeth-is-passing-on-one-very-unexpected-title-to-prince-charles-as-he-prepares-to-take-the-throne.html/">Prince Charles</a>. </p>

<p>Even when <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-become-the-face-of-the-royal-family-amid-news-harry-and-meghan-are-never-coming-back.html/">William and Kate</a> were dating, he was reportedly drawn to her family because they were the closest to normal he had ever known. The Middletons had no ties to aristocracy and gave William an escape from life under the royal spotlight. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1287042/royal-news-carole-middleton-kate-middleton-prince-william-immense-power-throne-spt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>,
royal expert Phil Dampier pointed out that Carole’s background as a successful
businesswoman also attracted William. Unlike those born into wealth, Carole
built her million-dollar company, Party Pieces, from the ground up and was
viewed as a “very strong woman.”</p>



<p>“Carole is a very strong woman who comes from quite a humble
background and the fact that she has worked herself up with a successful
business has given her a backbone of steel,” Dampier shared.</p>

<p>Carole has reportedly made millions of dollars with her company. The business was so successful, that even her husband quit his career to help her out, and Kate worked for her mom right before she tied the knot with William. </p>



<p>Kate has been a member of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/princess-diana-joined-the-royal-family-to-be-queen-not-just-a-princess-claims-her-private-secretary.html/">the royal family</a> for nearly a decade and she still turns to her mother for advice. As Dampier pointed out, Carole is a constant source of “comfort” for Kate, and she also spends plenty of time with her daughter’s three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.</p>



<h2>Carole Middleton is a ‘Diana-type’ mom </h2>



<p>Kate has become a great mom in her own right, but Carole’s influence over her has not waned over the past few years. And with Prince Harry and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-chose-a-very-meaningful-outfit-for-her-first-tv-appearance-since-leaving-the-royal-family.html/">Meghan Markle</a> out of the picture, William and Kate are feeling more pressure than ever to step up their game. </p>



<p>An inside source claims that Carole is a “stabilizing and
supportive force” for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, especially when
it comes to watching their children. </p>



<p>“Carole is very much a power behind the throne and her
influence is immense,” the source explained.</p>

Not only have the Middletons become like a second family to William, but Carole is “a Diana-type” mom to the future King of the United Kingdom. </p>



<p>Over the years, Carole has spent a good deal of time at the
couple’s country estate, Anmer Hall, while they frequently pay her visits at
Berkshire. The insider noted that William has been leaning more heavily on
Kate’s family following his brother’s exit, a move that has not gone over well
with Charles. </p>



<h2>Prince Charles and Carole Middleton butt heads</h2>



<p>Back in 2017, a friend of the royals revealed that Charles does not get to spend as much time as he would like with his grandchildren. The source claims that Charles blames this on the Middletons, who seem to get free rein with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/prince-charles-reportedly-blames-kate-middletons-parents-for-not-being-able-to-see-prince-george-more-often.html/">William and Kate’s children</a>. </p>



<p>“He certainly feels William spends more time with the
Middletons than he does with his own family,” the source dished.</p>



<p>In an interview in 2018, Carole admitted that she is a very
“hands-on” grandmother. She also stated that her family is her top
priority in life and that she always makes time for her grandchildren. </p>

<p>Charles has also gained a reputation for valuing family time, but his duties to the crown come above all else. This is something William alluded to during an interview for the 2019 documentary, <em>Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70</em>.</p>



<p>“When he’s there, he’s brilliant [but] we need him there as much as
possible,” William stated. </p>



<p>Prince Charles has not addressed the rumors surrounding <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-kate-middletons-mother-carole-middleton-was-worried-about-her-daughters-relationship-with-prince-william.html/">Carole Middleton</a> and his grandchildren, but he has reportedly broached the topic with other members of the royal family in previous years. </p>
