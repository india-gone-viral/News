<p>President Donald Trump gave a lengthy explanation during his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday about his struggle to walk down a ramp the previous weekend, which was captured on video and prompted speculation about his health.</p><p>At one point on Saturday, Trump jokingly reenacted his descent down the ramp at West Point, where he had spoken to graduating students.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">â€”andrew kaczynskiðŸ¤”  (@KFILE) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1274505250498580481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Trump told the Tulsa crowd he had struggled with the ramp in part because he was wearing leather-bottomed shoes and had been worn out from the heat and saluting roughly 600 cadets.</p><p>He also said the ramp was slippery, "like an ice skating rink," and had no handrails for him to grip.</p>



<p>"I said, 'There's no way.' You understand â€” I just saluted almost 600 times, I just made a big speech, I sat for other speeches, I'm being baked, I'm being baked like a cake," Trump said. "I said, 'General, there is no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, general.'"</p><p>He said he started his "journey" down the ramp "inch by inch," and demonstrated by stumbling across the Tulsa stage, while the audience responded with laughter and applause.</p><p>Trump also accused the media of cutting off the end of the clip, in which he claimed he "ran down" the remaining 10 feet of the ramp.</p><p>"I looked very handsome," Trump said. "I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing, because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10."</p>



<p>Video clips of the incident did not appear to show Trump running down the ramp, but he could be seen taking a few small, quick steps at the bottom.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">â€”Aaron Rupar  (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1271902553417138176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Trump also appeared irritated at the speculation about his health, noting that the first lady had told him some viewers believed he had Parkinson's disease.</p><p>"They say, 'There's something wrong with our president.' I'll let you know if there's something wrong," Trump said.</p><p>He also discussed criticism over how he had struggled to lift a glass of water to his mouth. Trump then lifted a glass of water and drank from it in front of the Tulsa crowd, to cheers and applause.</p>
