This makes Gap Simon's biggest in-line tenant at its malls in terms of rent. </p><p>Gap also warned in late April that litigation could arise as a result of its skipped payments. "Although we believe that strong legal grounds exist to support our claim that we are not obligated to pay rent for the stores that have been closed ... there can be no assurance that such arguments will succeed," the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the time. </p><p>Simon is asking the court to order Gap to pay up to $66 million, in addition to future rent payments. </p><p>Representatives from Simon and Gap did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for additional comment. </p><p>Simon Chief Executive Officer David Simon has made it clear he expects rent to be paid, despite any temporary store closures. </p><p>"The bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid," he told analysts during a May 11 earnings conference call. </p><p>Gap shares were down 2.1% in Thursday's premarket. Simon shares were up 4%. </p><p>Gap is set to report quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon. </p></div></div>
