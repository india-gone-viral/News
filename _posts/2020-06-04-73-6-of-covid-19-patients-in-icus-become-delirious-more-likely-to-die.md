        More than 73% of patients admitted to intensive care units in the United States with coronavirus experienced delirium, which lasted for an average of seven days, a study conducted by researches from the Indiana University School of Medicine revealed. </p><p>The researchers also found that "mortality was 26.4% in patients with delirium compared to 15.8% in patients without delirium," the study concluded. </p><p>Implications of the study mean that doctors should pay more attention and treat patients with delirium as their condition is more likely to worsen.</p><p>"Clinical attention to prevent and manage delirium and reduce delirium duration and severity is urgently needed for patients with COVID-19," the researchers wrote as a result of their findings.</p><p>The researches further noticed that "invasive mechanical ventilation is significantly associated with odds of delirium."</p><p>Previous studies conducted on COVID-19  and delirium have been published, including one in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30203-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Lancet</em></a>, showing that "People hospitalized with severe coronavirus infections are likely to experience delirium, confusion or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)," which examined coronavirus cases from Italy and the UK.</p><p>Furthermore, a study conducted in Wuhan, China, it was found that 36% of coronavirus patients had neurological symptoms such as strokes and headaches.</p>
