      <span>"This Pride month, I will be specifically educating myself on how I can better support and stand up for my black LGBTQ friends and family. I have joined a book & accountability club which will promote discussion on learnings and help identify how and when to action these learnings. On a fashion note, I’ll be wearing my rainbow running shades and rainbow bandana on every run during this month." —Julie</span>

      <span>"While I'm upset I can't march this year, everyone can use their skills or talents to celebrate Pride — because it can exist in anything. So as a writer, I'm working on my lesbian rom-com screenplay. If I were a chef, I would donate meals to homeless LGBTQ centers. There's always something you can do in your wheelhouse to help the community." —Alison</span>

      <span>"I was actually never very into Pride...partially due to a natural aversion to crowds...but really more because of my own internalized homophobia. But one day my then-BF looked at me and said, “You don’t like Pride because you have no pride.” It was a big wake-up call. Now that we don’t get to celebrate in person, I realize the importance of Pride more than ever. For this year's Pride, I will be drinking champagne in my Mariah Carey rainbow tank while I listen to <i>Glitter</i>. Get festive, dahling!" —Rory</span>

      <span>"I always love Pride events because it feels bittersweet to be surrounded by people who have dealt with similar struggles in their lives. It's a celebration of our uniqueness and our continuous fight for equality. Since we can't gather in large groups this year, I'm going to take the time to reflect back on the milestones our community has surpassed and read old stories of the heroes who came before us, those who made it possible for us to live our truths." —Tara</span>
