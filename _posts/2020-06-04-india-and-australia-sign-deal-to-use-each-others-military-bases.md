    <div id="body-200771816342556199"><p>India and Australia have sealed a deal to get access to each other's military bases, the Indian foreign ministry said - a pact that would clear the way for more military exchanges and exercises in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>The mutual logistic support agreement was signed during a virtual summit between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Thursday.</p>

</ul><p>The agreement allows Indian and Australian military ships and aircraft to refuel and access maintenance facilities at each other's bases.</p>
<p>India has a similar pact with the United States, which is seen as part of broader security cooperation to balance China's growing economic and military weight in the region.</p>
<p>Indian troops are locked in a standoff with Chinese troops on their disputed border, the most serious crisis in years, on top of concerns about a huge trade imbalance in Beijing's favour.</p>
<p>Australia's trade frictions with China are also growing, and its push last month for an international review into the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus drew opposition from China.</p>
<p>Morrison was due in India in January but was forced to cancel the trip because of the bushfires crisis in Australia.</p>
<p>The holding of the summit now, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, showed the importance the two leaders attached to bilateral ties, officials said.</p>
<p>"This is the first time that Prime Minister Modi will be holding a bilateral virtual summit. This signifies the strengthening of ties with Australia and its upward trajectory," Indian foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said before the signing of the deal.</p>
<p>India is also considering Australia's participation in annual naval exercises it holds with the US and Japan in the Indian and Pacific Oceans in a cementing of security ties between the four countries, military officials said.</p>
<p>A similar exercise in 2007 had angered China.</p></div>
