<p>Scientists discovered two colossal super-eruptions 8.7 and 9 million years ago, which suggests the massive volcano, on average, erupted once every 500,000 years</p></div><p>Thomas Knott, a volcanologist at the University of Leicester in the UK and the paper's lead author, said: 'We discovered that deposits previously believed to belong to multiple, smaller eruptions were in fact colossal sheets of volcanic material from two previously unknown super-eruptions at about 9.0 and 8.7 million years ago.'</p><p>The younger of the two, known as Grey's Landing super-eruption, spewed hot volcanic glass over 8,800 square miles, which is an area similar to the size of New Jersey.</p><p>'The younger of the two, the Grey's Landing super-eruption, is now the largest recorded event of the entire Snake-River-Yellowstone volcanic province,' said Knott. </p><div>  <p>Yellowstone National Park's supervolcano fuels famous geysers, mudspots and fumaroles, but new finds suggest the volcanic caldera's power is 'waning.' Because the park has only experienced two super-eruptions over the past three million years, experts are concerned the hotpot is enduring 'a very significant decline'</p></div><p>Based on the most recent collations of super-eruption sizes, he added, 'It is one of the top five eruptions of all time.'</p><p>The team notes that the younger eruption was 30 percent larger than the previous record holder, Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, and had devastating local and global effects.</p><p>The two eruptions led the team to investigate the supervolcano, which made them suggest may be waning.</p><p>During their analysis, the team used a combination of techniques, including bulk chemistry, magnetic data and radio-isotopic dates, to correlate volcanic deposits scattered across tens of thousands of square miles.</p><p>Both of the newly discovered super-eruptions occurred during the Miocene, the interval of geologic time spanning 23 to 5.3 million years ago.</p><div>  <p>The younger of the two, known as Grey's Landing super-eruption (top right), spewed hot volcanic glass over 8,800 square miles, which is an area similar to the size of New Jersey</p></div><p>'These two new eruptions bring the total number of recorded Miocene super-eruptions at the Yellowstone-Snake River volcanic province to six,' says Knott.</p><p>Knott's statement suggests that the super-eruptions during the  the Miocene was, on average, once every 500,000 years.</p><p>And the findings also provide 'little bearing on assessing the risk of another super-eruption occurring today in Yellowstone,' said Knott.</p><p>'We have demonstrated that the recurrence rate of Yellowstone super-eruptions appears to be once every 1.5 million years,' he said.</p><p>'The last super-eruption there was 630,000 years ago, suggesting we may have up to 900,000 years before another eruption of this scale occurs.'</p><p>However, Knott also added that the estimate is simply just that and he emphasizes scientists and officials to monitor the area and to issue warnings of any uptickwell in advance.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-e735edb0-a67f-11ea-bed8-df7ee82b9ab1"><div

SUPERVOLCANO BE PREVENTED?</h3><div> <div>  <p>Recent research found a small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, beneath the surface</p></div><p>Nasa believes drilling up to six miles (10km) down into the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park to pump in water at high pressure could cool it.</p><p>Despite the fact that the mission would cost $3.46 billion (£2.63 billion), Nasa considers it 'the most viable solution.' </p><p>Using the heat as a resource also poses an opportunity to pay for plan - it could be used to create a geothermal plant, which generates electric power at extremely competitive prices of around $0.10 (£0.08) per kWh.</p><p>But this method of subduing a supervolcano has the potential to backfire and trigger the supervolcanic eruption Nasa is trying to prevent.</p><p>'Drilling into the top of the magma chamber 'would be very risky;' however, carefully drilling from the lower sides could work. </p><div>  <p>This USGS graphic shows

Yellowstone with drilling is not simple.</p><p>Doing so would be an excruciatingly slow process that one happen at the rate of one metre a year, meaning it would take tens of thousands of years to cool it completely. </p><p>And still, there wouldn't be a guarantee it would be successful for at least hundreds or possibly thousands of years. </p> </div></div></mol-permabox></div>
