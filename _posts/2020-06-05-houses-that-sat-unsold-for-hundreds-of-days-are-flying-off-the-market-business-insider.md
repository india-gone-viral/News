<p>Suburban houses in Connecticut and upstate New York that have lingered on the market for months or even years are being <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/04/frantic-new-yorkers-snatch-up-unwanted-homes-in-the-suburbs/">snatched up during the coronavirus pandemic</a>, Michelle Sinclair Colman reported for the New York Post.</p><p>Real-estate agents say demand has skyrocketed since March in towns like Darien and Salisbury in Connecticut, and the Hudson Valley and the Catskills in upstate New York.</p><p>"Folks are buying sight unseen," Jeff Serouya, a Berkshire Hathaway agent in the Hudson Valley, told the Post. "And at a time when we're not able to meet with clients, with guidelines imposed on us to get properties shown without putting anyone in danger."</p><p>Many of these buyers are coming from New York City — and they aren't being picky, agents said. </p><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="Darien, Connecticut" data-content-type="image/jpeg" data-srcs="{"https://i.insider.com/5ed92cb719182477b81c6bf8":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","aspectRatioW":4,"aspectRatioH":3}}" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></img>

Mail-forwarding requests showed that many of them went out to their <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hamptons-residents-upset-new-yorkers-invading-coronavirus-2020-3">second homes or rentals in the Hamptons</a>, the go-to vacation destination for affluent New Yorkers. Many others went to upstate New York and Connecticut.</p><p>One moving company saw a 75% surge in relocations from NYC to Connecticut between March 15 and April 28, according to the Post. <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/gov-ned-lamont-people-could-move-from-new-york-city-to-connecticut.html">Connecticut's governor said in May</a> that "phones are ringing off the hook at real-estate agent offices."</p><p>In Darien, a $750,000 home that had been sitting on the market for 1,083 days sold to a young couple in March. And in the Catskills, a three-bedroom cabin that had barely gotten any interest for a year was snapped up for $1.2 million as soon as the pandemic hit, agents told the Post.</p><h2>The coronavirus pandemic is transforming the US real-estate market</h2><p>The pandemic has already upended the real-estate market across the US.</p>



<p>On average, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-of-the-housing-market-in-mid-may-in-the-midst-of-the-pandemic-2020-5">homes have been sitting on the market</a> for longer than usual, and new listings have dropped, but prices are still on a slightly upward trend, Business Insider's Libertina Brandt recently reported.</p><p>In the already expensive Hamptons, rental prices in <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/upper-middle-class-priced-out-of-hamptons-rental-market-coronavirus-2020-5">have skyrocketed</a>, pricing out even moderately wealthy people.
