However, when he bowled his first delivery there, he announced himself on the world stage as the danger man.</p><p>Warne's iconic had leg-spinner pitched outside leg and turned almost square to knock off the off stump and leave Gatting and even umpire Dickie Bird in disbelief. The delivery went on to be known as 'ball-of-the-century'.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">We're never getting over this, Warney <a href="https://t.co/JXEAU9KGhR" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/JXEAU9KGhR</a></p>â€” ICC (@ICC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ICC/status/1268377152279285761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>Talking about that delivery, Warne had said, "With the ball to Gatting, all I tried to do was pitch on leg stump and spin it a fair way."</p><p>"As it left my hand it felt just about perfect. When a leg-break works really well it curves away to the leg side in the air before pitching and spinning back the other way. The curve in the air comes from the amount of spin on the ball, and in this case I had managed to put quite a lot of purchase on this delivery. That is why it dipped and curved away so far and then spun back such a long way," Warne was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo</p><p>"I knew I'd bowled Gatt and I could tell by the look on Healy's face behind the stumps that the ball had done something special, but it was not until I saw a replay during the lunch break that I fully realised how much it had done."</p><p>However, later, Warne had also admitted in an interview how his life changed after that ball as he was scrutinized by media all the time after rising to fame.</p><p>Shane Warne finished his career with 708 Test wickets and is still counted among the greatest spinner of all time. The Australian took 195 wickets in Ashes Tests, which is the most by any bowler and against an opponent.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>IndiaToday.in</strong> has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-precautions-symptoms-global-impact-complete-guide-1657761-2020-03-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read our comprehensive guide</a> (with information on how the virus spreads, precautions and symptoms), <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/coronavirus-outbreak-5-big-myths-busted-1654318-2020-03-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch an expert debunk myths</a>, and access our <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated coronavirus page</a>.</em></p></div><div><p>Get real-time alerts and all the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/news.html">news</a> on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from</p></div></div><br/><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/this-day-27-years-ago-shane-warne-ball-of-century-stunned-mike-gatting-first-ashes-ball-1685410-2020-06-04" class="button purchase" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read More</a>
