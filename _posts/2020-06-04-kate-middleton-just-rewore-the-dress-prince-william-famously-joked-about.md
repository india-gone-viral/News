Seeing their cute faces smushed onto webcam together is definitely a highlight, but our favourite part of these calls are Kate's outfit choices, which continue to send important messages.</p><p>First, <a data-ylk="slk:royal fans noticed" href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/celebrity/a32484738/kate-middleton-zoom-wardrobe/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">royal fans noticed</a> that the Duchess' wardrobe became more colourful than before showing the family's support for the NHS - symbolised nationwide by a rainbow.</p><p>Now, Kate is sending another message with her latest outfit, a look that even warranted a comment from Prince William.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess' latest engagement via video link was to mark Australia's 'Thank a First Responder Day' recognising the country's key workers. For the occasion, Kate opted for a vibrant yellow dress, but it's not just any dress.</p><figure><p><img alt="Photo credit: Kensington Palace" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KWj_FNyoLQ416BOwmBZwTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/en5G2EizYaexpBdgjQLtlw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/63ac7be3a7f9b305567db6ef7ec4b1ff" src=""></img></p><figcaption>Photo credit: Kensington Palace</figcaption></figure><p>If you think the outfit looks familiar, that's because it is. Kate first wore the dress for the couple's royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, back in 2014.</p><p>Here's the Duchess sporting the look on the steps of the Sydney Opera House six years earlier:</p><figure><p><img alt="Photo credit: Getty Images" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YekroXftsnk7_pPg1ofaug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FG3wxawggArI90YPvpg6OA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/d1772d09e243cf444aa12e3ad0cd55ba" src=""></img></p><figcaption>Photo credit: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, Kate revealed to the crowd that William had playfully teased her about the dress, "William said I look like a banana!" <a data-ylk="slk:Hello Magazine" href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/royal-style/2020060390845/prince-william-teased-kate-middleton-yellow-dress/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hello Magazine</a> reported.
