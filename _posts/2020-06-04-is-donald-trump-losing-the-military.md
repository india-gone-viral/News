<p>Is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> losing the military? For the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/02/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-threatens-deploy-military/">self-proclaimed president of “law and order”</a> it is a strange thing to ponder but after the extraordinary last 24 hours the question is now warranted.</p>
<p>The backdrop is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/02/analysis-donald-trump-chose-fist-monday-night-leaving-nation/">the growing militarisation of the response</a> to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/george-floyd-protests-america-riots-us/">the anti-racism demonstrations</a> that has ticked up and up and up in the last week, as violence spread and clashes played out by the White House.</p>
<p>But the trigger was the one-two blow of twin interventions from people who have sat around Mr Trump’s cabinet table that had historians scratching their heads for modern-day comparisons.</p>
<p>First went <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/pentagon-chief-says-opposes-using-troops-counter-protests-breaking/">the current defence secretary</a>. Mark Esper, who had joined the president for his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/02/donald-trumps-america-president-uses-tear-gas-get-photo-opportunity/">Bible-holding photo-op</a> as protesters were forced back by police on Monday, spoke out.</p>
<p>Mr Esper, dressed in spectacles and a suit, said that only in “the most urgent and dire of situations” should troops be used in the streets. “We are not in one of those situations now," he added.</p>

<div data-test="article-body-text">
<p>In other words, in public, with the cameras rolling, Mr Esper had said the idea his own boss had floated only on Monday - of deploying the military to counter protesters - was basically wrong.</p>
<p>Then came his predecessor. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/donald-trump-threat-constitution-saysformer-us-defence-secretary/">James Mattis, the four-star general</a> who vowed a “duty of silence” after leaving the administration only 18 months ago, decided he could be silent no more.</p>
<p>“I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled,” Mr Mattis, starting very much as he meant to go on, as the next 640-odd words would reveal.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us,” Mr Mattis wrote of his former boss.</p>
<p>The Lafayette Square controversy, the site of Mr Trump’s stroll to church after space <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/02/justin-welby-joins-chorus-criticism-donald-trumps-bible-photo/">had been cleared by using flash bangs and chemical gas on protesters</a>, was an “abuse of executive authority”, he added.</p>

<p>The scenes playing out now are the result of “three years without mature leadership,” Mr Mattis said. He even referenced the Nazis in warning of the dangers of a divide-and-conquer approach.</p>
<p>Taken together, the interventions were remarkable. These criticisms did not emanate from “radical left” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/democrats/">Democrats</a> or the “fake news” media, but two men Mr Trump hand-picked for top office.</p>
<p>Of perhaps even more interest is what it hints at about the tensions between Mr Trump and his generals, and what their soldiers are being asked to do for their commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>This week Mr Trump has had military helicopters flying above the streets of the capital, one with a pair of legs dangling out of the side like you see in war movies.</p>
<p>He has brought members of the 82nd Airborne Division to the outskirts of the city, close enough to be rapidly sent out onto streets he has vowed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/01/donald-trump-urges-governors-dominate-protesters-seventh-night/">control with “total domination”</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div data-test="article-body-text">
<p>If Mr Trump’s own defence secretary not only opposes military deployment but is willing to say so publicly, what must US generals be thinking behind closed doors?</p>
<p>If so concerned was Mr Mattis that he was willing to break his “duty of silence”, is it fair to speculate that those he served with less than two years ago could have similar views?</p>
<p>And if so, what does that mean if Mr Trump does try to follow through on his pledge to deploy soldiers if the lawlessness continues?</p>
<p>Suddenly such questions seem less fanciful than they may once have been - and all too real. </p>
