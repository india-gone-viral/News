						<p>Prosecutors in Seoul have requested the arrest of <a data-tag="lee-jae-yong" href="https://variety.com/t/lee-jae-yong/" id="auto-tag_lee-jae-yong">Lee Jae-yong</a>, the heir and presumptive head of the <a data-tag="samsung" href="https://variety.com/t/samsung/" id="auto-tag_samsung">Samsung</a> Group. He is accused of stock price manipulation and audit violations within the massively complicated web of Samsung-related companies.</p>
<p>Lee is closely related to Miky Lee, producer of Cannes- and Oscar-winning film “<a data-tag="parasite" href="https://variety.com/t/parasite/" id="auto-tag_parasite">Parasite</a>.” Lee Jae-yong (aka Jay Lee) currently has no operational role in <a data-tag="cj-entertainment" href="https://variety.com/t/cj-entertainment/" id="auto-tag_cj-entertainment">CJ Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>He has, however, been prominent in Korea’s fight against coronavirus. Lee put Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips, mobile devices and electronic displays, at the front of a drive to increase COVID-19 testing kits, It also provided $39 million of aid and loaned out doctors, engineers and a corporate jet.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lee’s problems are piling up. Reuters reports that he also faces trial on a charge of bribery aimed at winning support for him to succeed ailing group patriarch Lee Kun-hee. He and Samsung have both denied the accusations.</p>
<p>Lee was last month called in to speak to prosecutors, and held a press conference to apologize for the complications over succession and control. “I pledge to create a new Samsung that is level with the national dignity of South Korea,” he said.</p>


<p>In August 2017, Lee was sentenced to <a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/asia/samsung-boss-lee-jae-yong-jailed-for-five-years-1202538860/">five years in prison for corruption</a> intended to win support for the then Park Geun-hee government for a 2015 corporate manoeuvre which helped him tighten his control at Samsung. He was released from jail in February 2018.</p>
<p>Disgraced president, Park instituted a blacklist of entertainment talent who were not to receive government funding. She also leaned on CJ Entertainment to make patriotic movies such as “Roaring Currents” and “Ode to My Father.”</p>
