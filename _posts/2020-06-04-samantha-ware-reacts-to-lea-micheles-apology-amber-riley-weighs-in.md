						<p>Samantha Ware wasn’t moved by <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/06/03/lea-michele-apologizes-after-samantha-ware-accusations/">Lea Michele’s Instagram apology</a> after Ware claimed the “Glee” star made her life a “living hell” while they appeared on the series together.</p>
<p>Responding to Michele’s statement in which she wrote, in part, that the accusations made her “focus specifically on how my own behavior towards fellow cast members was perceived by them …,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Sammie_Ware/status/1268241676402745344" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ware shot back</a>: “Perceived? Purcieved? Purse? Open your purse??????????????”</p>
<p>Ware — who initially spoke out against Michele after the 33-year-old tweeted a message supporting the Black Lives Matter movement — also included a link to a GoFundMe that’s raising money for James Scurlock, who was shot and killed while protesting.</p>
<p>Ware, 28, played Jane Hayward on the show during Season 6.</p>
<p>Since Ware’s initial message, some “Glee” stars have come forward to voice their issues with Michele’s behavior, including Heather Morris, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/06/03/heather-morris-agrees-glee-co-star-lea-michele-was-unpleasant-on-set/">who described Michele as “unpleasant.”</a></p>

<p>“People are out here dying and being murdered by police …,” she said in a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8386841/Glee-star-Amber-Riley-says-doesnt-s-Lea-Michele-drama-amid-protests.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted to Twitter</a>, which since has been removed.</p>
<p>Michele, who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/06/02/hellofresh-cuts-ties-with-lea-michele-after-racism-accusations/">lost her partnership with HelloFresh</a> almost immediately after Ware accused her of <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/06/02/samantha-ware-blasts-glees-lea-michele-over-black-lives-matter/">committing “traumatic microaggressions,”</a> appeared to have at least one defender in Iqbal Theba, who played Principal Figgins on the hit show.</p>


<p>“Lot of people r assuming that @LeaMichele mistreated me. Let me state it clearly that I was never mistreated by her,” <a href="https://twitter.com/iqbaltheba/status/1268337212862521344" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he tweeted</a>. “And if some of the cast were treated badly then she has apologized for it which is wonderful. But being called a racist is too heavy & unfair a burden 4 most … of us, specially in these troubled times. So, please be compassionate, careful & responsible before we accuse anyone of this horrible thing called racism. I love each & everyone of my fellow cast members from our great show @OfficialGLEEtv Be safe & be well. Much love ❤️”</p>
