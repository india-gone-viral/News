        </figure><p>In determining the UK's alert level, the four chief medical officers considered a number of factors including:</p><ul><li>Covid-19's reproduction (R) number, a scientific measure of how fast the virus is spreading</li>
<li>The number of new coronavirus infections and whether this daily figure has been consistently falling</li>
<li>Whether the number of Covid-19 hospital and intensive care admissions and deaths per day has also fallen for the past four weeks </li>
</ul><p>Mr Hancock said recent progress in these factors showed "a real testament to the British people's determination to beat this virus".</p><p>"Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet," he added. </p><p>The move comes weeks after some restrictions were first eased in each UK nation.</p><figure><span>

        </figure><p>The alert level is telling us what we already know - the virus is still here, but at much lower levels.</p><p>It combines all the data on coronavirus in the UK to give a single, clear message about the current threat.</p><p>But how closely it is tied to government decisions is debatable.</p><p>Boris Johnson announced the relaxation of a range of measures - including the reopening of shops in England - while we were still at Level 4.</p><p>Although the decision - by the UK's chief medical officers - would make any decisions to relax the 2m rule or open pubs and restaurants politically easier. </p><p>However, it doesn't mean that we can all relax and stop social distancing and practicing good hygiene. Remember the alert level can go up as well as down. </p><figure><span>

        </figure><p>At the end of May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs that "we're coming down the Covid alert system from level four to level three tomorrow, we hope, we're going to be taking a decision tomorrow".</p><p>But the next day, the government decided instead not to lower the alert level and it remained at four until now.</p><figure><span>
