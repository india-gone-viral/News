<p>Andre Silva headed Eintracht into the lead in the 61st minute off a cross from Filip Kostic, before Ilsanker entered the game in the 81st and made an immediate impact.</p>
<p>Seconds after coming on, the Austrian scored with his first touch, tapping in a deflected corner.</p>
<p>He made it 3-0 in the 90th minute with a header from a free kick. That was the 20th goal Werder has conceded from a set piece in the Bundesliga this season, more than any other team. Ilsanker had not scored a league goal since 2015.</p>
<p>“It’s like a ketchup bottle. For a long time you get nothing out, then it all comes at once,” Ilsanker said in televised comments.</p>

It’s second to last in the table and three points away from safety with five games left to play. Frankfurt moves up to 11th and is now three league games unbeaten.</p>
