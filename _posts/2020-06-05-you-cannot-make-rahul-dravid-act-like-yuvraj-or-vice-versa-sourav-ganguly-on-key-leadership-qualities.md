A leader should tap the natural talents of the team members. You cannot make Rahul Dravid act like Yuvraj or make Yuvraj be Rahul Dravid," Sourav Ganguly said on Unacademy while talking about leadership.</p><p>Current BCCI president also believes that being able to adapt to changes is among the key qualities of being a leader.</p><p>"The greatest of the leaders make mistakes, but as long as the intentions are right, everything else will fall into place. You should learn from your own mistakes and leave them behind to be a better version of yourself. Don't let your losses get you down, that's a part of growing up. Learning from failures will lead you to success," he added.f</p><p>After finishing his cricket career in 2012, Ganguly has taken up the administrative roles of the Indian cricket. He first served as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) before taking up the present responsibility as the BCCI President last October.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>IndiaToday.in</strong> has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-precautions-symptoms-global-impact-complete-guide-1657761-2020-03-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read our comprehensive guide</a> (with information on how the virus spreads, precautions and symptoms), <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/coronavirus-outbreak-5-big-myths-busted-1654318-2020-03-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch an expert debunk myths</a>, and access our <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated coronavirus page</a>.</em></p></div><div><p>Get real-time alerts and all the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/news.html">news</a> on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from</p></div></div><br/><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/sourav-ganguly-captaincy-rahul-dravid-yuvraj-leadership-1685637-2020-06-04" class="button purchase" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read More</a>
