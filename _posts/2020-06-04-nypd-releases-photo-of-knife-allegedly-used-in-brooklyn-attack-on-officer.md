						<p>This is the knife a man allegedly used to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/04/nypd-cops-shot-in-confrontation-with-suspect-in-brooklyn/">stab a police officer</a> in the neck in Brooklyn on Wednesday night – a confrontation that ended with two cops and the suspect being shot.</p>

<p>The man approached the officer on Church Street near Flatbush Avenue at about 11:45 p.m. and stabbed him in the neck, according to a police source.</p>
<p>Several officers responded to the scene, where one pulled his firearm, sources said.</p>
<p>The officer and the suspect then struggled for the weapon, which went off striking one officer in the hand and another in the arm. A sergeant responded to the scene and fired on the suspect, who was struck.</p>
<p>The cops were rushed to Kings County Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said.</p>
<p>The suspect, who was arrested at the scene, was listed in critical condition.</p>
<p>“It appears to be a complete cowardly, despicable, unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a press conference.</p>
<p>The shooting comes amid <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/03/looters-strike-several-stores-in-nyc-but-curfew-appears-to-curb-chaos/">citywide protests against police brutality</a> in the wake of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/minneapolis-cop-puts-knee-on-neck-of-black-man-who-later-died-video/">George Floyd’s death</a> while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>
