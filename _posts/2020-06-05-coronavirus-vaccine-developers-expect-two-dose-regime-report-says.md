      </p></div><p>When vaccine candidates reach human clinical trials, more precise dosing will become clear, Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education for the Immunization Action Coalition, told the outlet.</p><p>After the first dose of a vaccine, the immune system develops <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-most-who-recover-carry-antibodies-study">antibodies </a>and immune cells in about 14 days, says L.J. Tan, chief strategy officer with the Immunization Action Coalition and co-chair of the National Adult Immunization Summit and National Influenza Vaccine Summit.</p><p>Tan estimated any COVID-19 vaccine requiring two doses would likely be administered about a month or two apart.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-has-not-resurged-in-oregon-following-reopenings-state-health-official-says">CORONAVIRUS HAS NOT RESURGED IN OREGON FOLLOWING REOPENINGS, STATE HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS</a></strong></p><p>In addition, WHO officials said the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/who-says-coronavirus-isnt-mutating-into-dangerous-form">coronavirus isn’t mutating to become more dangerous </a>during a briefing on Wednesday. Since the SARS-CoV-2 is seemingly stable so far, initial vaccines could act as boosters later on to extend immunity, Bloom told the outlet.</p><p>However, scientists aren’t sure how durable people’s immune response will be. For coronaviruses causing the common cold, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said immunity almost always lasts less than a year.</p><div source=""><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" ><source media="(min-width: 767px)" ><img alt="A two-dose regimen in treating COVID-19 nationwide may demand more extensive coordination and record keeping to ensure patients receive the full course of vaccination, experts say.
