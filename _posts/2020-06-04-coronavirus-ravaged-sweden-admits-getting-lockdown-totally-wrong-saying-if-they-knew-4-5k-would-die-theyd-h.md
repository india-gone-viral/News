<div><p>SWEDEN says it was wrong not to impose lockdown rules adding if it knew thousands would die it would have probably followed the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>The frank admission comes just days after it was revealed the Scandinavian country <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11741095/sweden-coronavirus-weekly-deaths-per-capita/" rel="">had the highest Covid-19 death rate per capita of anywhere in the world</a>.</p>

<p>“If we would encounter the same disease, with exactly what we know about it today, I think we would land midway between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world did,” he said.</p>
<p>It would be “good to know exactly what to shut down to curb the spread of infection better”, he then added.</p>
<p>Sweden has recorded 4,542 deaths and 40,803 infections in a population of 10 million, while Denmark, Norway and Finland who imposed lockdowns have seen much lower rates.</p>
<p>Denmark has seen 580 deaths, Norway has had 237 deaths and Finland 321 while Sweden reported a further 74 deaths today alone.</p>

<p>This week the Swedish government bowed to mounting opposition pressure and promised to set up a commission to look into its controversial Covid-19 strategy.</p>
<p>Sweden has taken a soft-touch approach to fighting the virus, leaving most schools, shops and restaurants open and relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene.</p>
<p>It also banned gatherings of more than 50 people and halted visits to elderly care homes.</p>
<p>Non-essential travel is still not recommended under national guidelines, but journeys of up to two hours are allowed to see relatives or close friends.</p>

<p>And they have not done enough to stop the spread, including taking extra hygiene measures such as washing their hands more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Last week, the Swedish model was described by former state epidemiologist Annika Linde as "not the smartest".</p>
<p>Pointing to Sweden's Nordic neighbours, the virologist told <a href="https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/lindes-skarpa-kritik-skyller-pa-varandra/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Expressen</a> they had "succeeded quite well" by comparison in limiting the killer bug's rampage through their countries.</p>

<p>"The Swedish model may not have been the smartest in all respects," Linde said.</p>
<p>But, the 72-year-old said it was completely pointless bringing in a strict lockdown now.</p>
<p>"I don't think a shutdown will benefit now - I think it's too late," Linde said.</p>
