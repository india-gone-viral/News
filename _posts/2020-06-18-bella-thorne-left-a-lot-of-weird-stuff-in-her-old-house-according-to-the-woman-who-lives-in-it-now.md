  <h2>
    

    
      <span>But what's super interesting about Bella's old house is how much stuff she left behind! Like her Teen Choice Award from 2015 that Rachel and her friends found under a bunch of stuff in the garage, so they decided to frame it:</span>

      <span>Rachel also said they've discovered a lot of surprisingly personal things in the house. "I don’t know how she was when she left, because she left a lot of sentimental things that I would think she would want. She left a gift bag that was engraved from her grandparents and her medical records."</span>
