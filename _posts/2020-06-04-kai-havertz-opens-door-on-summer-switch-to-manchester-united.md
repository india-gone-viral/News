                <p>Manchester United are preparing for a huge summer in the transfer market as they prepare to mount a challenge for the Premier League title.</p>
<p>Several names have already been linked, but the latest is arguably the most exciting of all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-havertz-transfer-news-18361367" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to the Manchester Evening News</a>, Kai Havertz could be tempted by a move to Old Trafford.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old, <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/kai-havertz/leistungsdaten/spieler/309400" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who is valued at Â£72m by Transfermarkt</a>, is arguably the hottest young prospect in world football at the moment after an impressive campaign for Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
<p>Havertz has scored 15 and created 8 in all competitions so far this term as well as being handed the captain's armband for the 5th place side.</p>


<p>The midfielder is a key player for Leverkusen but given their struggles to get into the Champions League, it seems that Havertz could be tempted by a move to one of Europe's biggest clubs.</p>
<p>Numerous teams are said to be keen on a move, however news that he could be open to a switch to Old Trafford is a massive boost for a player who has been tipped as 'the next Zinedine Zidane'.</p>
<p><strong>GIVEMESPORT'S Phil Spencer says...</strong></p>
<p>What a deal this would be.</p>
<p>Kai Havertz is arguably the most exciting prospect in world football at the moment, and it seems that he's a player with quality and consistency to be a regular feature at the top of the game.</p>
<p>If Manchester United can fight off competition from elsewhere to secure this deal it would be a massive step in the right direction as they look to get themselves back on track.</p>
<p>United have also been linked with a move for Jadon Sancho, and while a move for both seems unlikely, if they could attract the worlds' two most talented youngsters then it would be a real signal of intent.</p>
