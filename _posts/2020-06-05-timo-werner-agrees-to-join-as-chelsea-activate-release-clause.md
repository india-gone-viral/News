<p id="5WHWm0">Things have escalated rather quickly today, as they often do in our transfer market moves, and the transfer of Timo Werner to Chelsea looks set to go ahead indeed.</p>
<p id="6AolUF">The story broke in Germany, <a href="https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2020/6/4/21280521/timo-werner-rejects-liverpool-and-leipzig-set-to-sign-with-chelsea-report">with Sport Bild</a>, but now all the usual Chelsea suspects have chimed in as well.</p>
<p id="oJi2bT">Fabrizio Romano reports that Chelsea are ready with a bid <a href="https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1268587978999377920">in the next few hours</a> — i.e. paying the 24-year-old’s €55m buyout clause — which is then confirmed by a report from Nizaar Kinsella of Goal who says that Werner’s agent has been spotted in Leipzig, presumably with one of those giant checks signed by Abramovich.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chelsea are looking to activate Timo Werner's release clause of €60m. Karlheinz Förster has been spotted in Leipzig with the Blues advancing.

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Timo Werner and his agents confirmed to Chelsea that they’re “ready” to consider and agree details for the contract offered until June 2025.

<p id="MeyKlh">That all sounds quite excellent.  Werner is a tremendous proven goalscorer with 92 goals in 154 appearances for RB Leipzig, including 31 in all competitions this season.  Whether as a lone striker or paired with Tammy Abraham, he should be a fantastic signing for Chelsea!</p>
