(Reuters Photo)</p></div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Former Australia spinner Brad Hogg feels that India skippe Virat Kohli's consistent run in big run chases makes him better than his deputy Rohit Sharma in white-ball cricket.</p><p>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been the mainstays of India's batting in the shorter formats in recent times. While Kohli is currently the top ranked ODI batsman his deputy Rohit is placed at the second spot. And, so the debate rages on as to who among these two is the better batsman.</p><p>Brad Hogg uploaded a Question and Answer video on his official YouTube channel, in which the cricketer weighed in on Kohli vs Rohit debate when a fan questioned, "Who is better at white-ball and why? Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma?"</p><p>"Well, Virat Kohli, because he's more consistent when India have the big run chases. When India are batting second, he stands up and delivers," Hogg said.</p><p>"But you really cannot compare the two as they have different roles. Rohit's role is to be aggressive against the new ball bowlers when field restrictions are at their least and Virat's role is to bat through the innings and make sure he's there at the end, so they complement each other," he added.</p><p>Recently, former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara had compared the pair of Rohit and Kohli to that of former India greats Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, calling them the "defining pair" for the team in the modern era.</p><p>Heaping rich praise on the Indian captain and limited-overs vice-captain, Sangakkara said that the two make batting look so easy by playing "orthodox" cricketing shots without taking much risk.</p><p>"If you take the modern-day game, India has two of the best players in Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who play orthodox cricket but who are just absolutely destructive in any format of the game. You donâ€™t have to muscle the ball or put too much effort or look ugly doing it, they just play good cricket shots and results come," Sangakkara said on Star Sports' show Cricket Connected.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>IndiaToday.in</strong> has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-precautions-symptoms-global-impact-complete-guide-1657761-2020-03-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read our comprehensive guide</a> (with information on how the virus spreads, precautions and symptoms), <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/coronavirus-outbreak-5-big-myths-busted-1654318-2020-03-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch an expert debunk myths</a>, and access our <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated coronavirus page</a>.</em></p></div><div><p>Get real-time alerts and all the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/news.html">news</a> on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from</p></div></div><br/><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/brad-hogg-on-virat-kohli-vs-rohit-sharma-better-odi-cricketer-1685499-2020-06-04" class="button purchase" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read More</a>
