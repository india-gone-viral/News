<h2>4-Year Old Novak Djokovic Playing Tennis</h2>
<p>As you can see in the above video, 4-year old Novak Djokovic is just starting to learn how to play tennis. Since he is just starting to learn, he is struggling to hit the ball with his racquet. But that would have been the case for every single tennis player in the world.</p>
<p>The Serb will be looking at this video with a smile as it shows how far he has come. He started out as a young boy who could not even hit a tennis ball and he has now become a player who is in the race to become the GOAT of tennis and who could probably win it.</p>

<p>For a long time, only <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/roger-federer">Roger Federer</a> and <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> were contenders in the race to become the GOAT of tennis. But with recent successes, Novak has also become a major contender. To win this race, he must end up holding one record ‚Äì the most Grand Slam titles.</p>
<p>This record is being held by Roger Federer who has 20 titles to his name but Novak is not far behind. After his win at the 2020 Australian Open, he took his tally to 17. And if he continues to play the way he has been playing, he will break this record in no time.</p>
<p>He is probably training extremely hard right now so that he will be at his best when he gets the next opportunity to get closer to beating this record. And that opportunity is going to come in August when the ATP Tour returns from its <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-extends-tour-suspension#:~:text=The%20ATP%20has%20extended%20the,not%20take%20place%20as%20scheduled.">suspension</a>.</p>
