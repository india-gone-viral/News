											WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET A TEST. PKG2 >> BEFORE TODAY TESTING WAS JUST FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. NOW IT’S OPEN TO ANYONE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. ANTIBODY TESTS CAN TELL IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 IN THE PAST. IT’S NOT CLEAR WHETHER TESTING POSITIVE FOR ANTIBODIES COULD MEAN YOU ARE FROM VIRUS OR WHETHER YOU ARE ABLE TO SPREAD IT. TESTING FOR THE VIRUS WILL CONTINUE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER. THEY WILL HAVE 125 TESTS AVAILABLE PER DAY. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE IN ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.
