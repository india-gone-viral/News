            <p>Early on in the pandemic, reports that <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/coronavirus-explained-symptoms-lockdowns-and-all-your-covid-19-questions-answered/">COVID-19</a></span> doesn't always affect children as badly as it strikes adults <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">came as a welcome relief</a>. As with many illnesses, older adults and those with compromised immune systems are known to be at higher risk for developing worse infections than healthy, young adults. But on the whole, kids didn't appear to be as afflicted, or get as sick when they were. At least that was the initial <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">understanding clinicians had of the disease</a>, which is caused by the <span><a data-component="linkTracker" data-link-tracker-options="{"action":"link_anchor"}" href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/coronavirus-and-covid-19-all-your-questions-answered/">coronavirus</a></span>. </p><p>But then things changed.

The symptoms vary greatly, as do their severity, but enough of these affected children have been <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-evidence-on-kids-and-covid-11590017095" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">admitted into intensive care</a> and placed <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/parenting/pmis-coronavirus-children.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on life support</a> to cause alarm.

What's the disease called and how is it affecting kids? How deadly is it? How is it being treated, and will it delay the reopening of schools? This story draws on available information from sources such as the <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.cdc.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CDC</a> and <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.who.int" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>.
