<p>There’s no way of knowing who will snatch the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/showtime-special-season-rupaul-drag-race-all-stars.html/">crown of <em>All-Stars 5</em></a>, nor who will make it to the finale. Fans do, however, have high hopes for some drag queens re-entering the Werk Room for this upcoming competition. Here are some of the fan-favorite front runners for <a href="http://cheatsheet.com/tag/rupauls-drag-race/"><em>RuPaul’s Drag Race: All-Stars 5</em></a>.</p>

</div></figure><h2>There are 10 queens sashaying back into the Werk Room for ‘All-Stars 5’</h2>



<p>They might not have won on their regular season of <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em>, but it’s <em>All-Stars </em>season, baby. Anything can happen. After waiting for over a year, fans of this reality series have the next season of RuPaul’s spinoff series. </p>



<p>The queens competing for their place in the “Drag Race Hall of Fame” are Ongina, Miz Cracker, Shea Couleé, Mayhem Miller, India Ferrah, Mariah Paris Balenciaga, Blair St. Clair, Jujubee, Alexis Mateo, and Derrick Barry. Who will snatch the crown, however, is still unclear.</p>

</div></figure><h2>Some fans shared their favorite contestants on social media</h2>



<p>Based on the number of likes on each queen’s post on the <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> Instagram account, the fan favorites of this season include Shea Couleé, Miz Cracker, Ongina, and Jujubee. Some viewers even took to social media, sharing their support for some performers of <em>All-Stars 5.</em></p>



<p>“Listen up, fives, a ten is on stage and her name is Shea Couleé,” <a href="https://twitter.com/notn1co/status/1263529393059622913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one Twitter user</a> said, sharing a picture of guest judge Jane Krakowski.</p>



<p>“Good morning Shea Couleé and Miz Cracker and a big thank you to All-Stars 5,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mattysmokes2/status/1258797491228520448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Twitter user </a>wrote.</p>

<p>Each queen brings their own unique style and personality to their drag. It’s hard to choose who, exactly, will be sashaying away and who will snatch the crown. </p>



<p>That’s primarily because of the many twists that come along with this spinoff series. In the past, frontrunner Ben Dela Creme eliminated herself. Shangela was eliminated because of a “jury of queens.”</p>



<p>Still, some fan favorites for this season include Shea Couleé, Miz Cracker, Blair St. Clair, Jujubee, and Miz Cracker. Presumably, more information, and new episodes, will be shared regarding these contestants in the coming weeks.</p>

</div></figure><h2>This is the first season of ‘All-Stars’ to premiere on VH1 in over a year</h2>



<p>This season of <em>All-Stars</em> has been a long time coming for fans of the reality series. <em>All-Stars 4</em> premiered during winter 2018, making it over a year since returning queens had a chance at ru-demption.</p>



<p>Past winners include Trixie Mattel, Alaska 5000, and Chad Michaels. For All-Stars 4, for the first time in <em>Drag Race</em> herstory, fans had two winners crowned. As a result, fans expect plenty of twists, turns, twirls, and death drops in this season on RuPaul’s spinoff series. New episodes of <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race: All-Stars 5.</em></p>
