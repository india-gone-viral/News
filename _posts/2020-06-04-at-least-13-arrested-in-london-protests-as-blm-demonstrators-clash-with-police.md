					<p>Pockets of protesters clashed with police after thousands of people flooded into central <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gangs-of-london/">London</a> for a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-lives-matter/">Black Lives Matter</a> demonstration in response to the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Activists chanted ‘black lives matter’ and ‘we will not be silent’ in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/06/03/thousands-gather-hyde-park-black-lives-matter-protest-12798955/">Hyde Park in a peaceful demonstration</a> before tensions escalated later outside Downing Street. The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/metropolitan-police/">Metropolitan Police</a> said 13 people were arrested during the protests, which ran into the early hours of Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Star Wars actor John Boyega was among those to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/06/03/john-boyega-passionate-speech-hyde-park-demonstration-following-george-floyds-death-12799584/">speak at the rally before protesters</a>, many wearing masks and holding placards, marched on Westminster. Mr Floyd died after a white officer held him down by pressing a knee into his neck in Minneapolis on May 25, sparking days of protest in the US.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ‘appalled and sickened’ to see what happened to Mr Floyd, while chief constables from across the UK issued a joint statement saying they ‘stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified’.</p>
<p>As Mr Johnson was speaking at the daily coronavirus press conference, videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street.</p>
<p>Footage showed objects including signs and a traffic cone being thrown at police while one protester could be seen being wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers.</p>
<p>Freelance journalist Mattha Busby filmed the moment and said it was ‘unclear exactly what started things’.</p>
<p>‘Police appeared to attempt to take a man from the crowd and pandemonium ensued,’ he tweeted.</p>

<p>Some officers were seen ‘taking a knee’ earlier in the day, but when protesters knelt at 6pm no police joined them.</p>
<p>At one point, police escorted a man to the side of the road who was bleeding from the head, with blood over his clothes and camera.</p>
<p>A crowd followed a group of officers to outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where protesters shouted ‘answer for your crimes’ and ‘no justice, no peace’.</p>
<p>Officers formed two lines and rested their batons on their shoulders, shouting ‘get back’ at protesters as they separated the crowds.</p>
<p>A reporter from Nine News Australia was also filmed abandoning his live broadcast to flee as tensions flared up.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said two men were arrested at Downing Street on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and violent disorder.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, a group of protesters descended on police – who were wearing helmets and holding batons – outside the Cabinet Office, which had been daubed with ‘BLM’ in black paint.</p>
<p>Both plastic and glass bottles were thrown in the direction of officers and protesters pulled down a line of temporary barriers outside Downing Street.</p>
<p>Despite rumours circulating on social media that The Cenotaph had been vandalised during the protests, police said they were ‘not aware of any damage’.</p>
<p>In the US, protests began in Minneapolis where Mr Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country.</p>
<p>Demonstrations have taken place in areas including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Columbia, South Carolina and Houston.</p>
<p>Some have included clashes between police and protesters, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump has pressed state governors to take a more forceful approach against protesters.</p>
