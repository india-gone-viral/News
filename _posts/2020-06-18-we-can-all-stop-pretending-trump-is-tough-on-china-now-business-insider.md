<p>I think we can all stop pretending Trump is tough on China now. </p><p>Revelations in former National Security Adviser John Bolton's forthcoming tell-all book about his time in the White House, "The Room Where It Happened," make it plain that Trump is not a China hawk. He's not a dove either. He's a Donald — completely transactional and motivated only by his own self interest. In this case that self interest is reelection.</p><p>Sure, under Trump the US started a trade war with China, which was expensive to both countries. But that was just him playing the same kind of grievance politics he's been pushing since the 1980s when <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-playboy-interview-trade-foreign-policy-japan-2017-2">his punching bag was Japan</a>. It just so happens, though, that when he started blaming China it rallied his base. So to win reelection — which is his singular desire  — he knows he has to deliver something. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-bolton-the-scandal-of-trumps-china-policy-11592419564">Wall Street Journal</a> piece previewing the book, Bolton wrote that Trump begged Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy farm products in order to please his base. <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-china-detention-camp-xinjiang-2020-6">Trump also gave Xi the okay</a> to "go ahead with building" the concentration camps where the Chinese government has imprisoned millions of Uighur Muslims, according to the book. Bolton also said Trump didn't want to get involved with Hong Kong's democratic protests because "we have human rights problems too."</p>



<p>When it comes to China, Bolton makes Trump sound like the flailing balloon man outside of the used car lot that is our once great nation. All he wants is a deal. Everything else is unimportant. Everything else can go.</p><h2>A president with no principles</h2><p>This makes sense based on the mixed messages the White House has sent about China for the past three years. China watchers will tell you that Trump's China policy has an unmistakable pattern.</p><p>First there's bluster from Trump about a specific issue be it trade, or violations of sanctions <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-deal-with-china-on-zte-sanctions-2018-5">by the tech giant</a><a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-deal-with-china-on-zte-sanctions-2018-5"> ZTE</a>, or spying; then the media speculates what will happen expecting the worst given his rhetoric; and then finally Trump makes a toothless announcement that does not reflect his prior tone.</p><p>Trump pulled this move just a few weeks ago. After China passed a security bill that will curtail Hong Kong's legal autonomy, Trump gave a press conference announcing a series of toothless measures that scared absolutely no one.</p>



<p>While Trump has signed bills criticizing the country for human rights abuses against Hong Kongers and Uighur Muslims, these came after both chambers of Congress had passed the bills with near-unanimous support. And Trump has been more concerned with his trade deal than with these human rights abuses. </p><p>Again, none of this makes Trump a China hawk. But it doesn't make him a dove either. He has no real intention of make China more democratic or pushing it toward a market-based economy. He just wants to do deals that make him look effective to his base so he can win reelection and look important with the authoritarian leaders who Trump clearly admires.</p><p>After all, even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump had <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-coronavirus-response-chaos-helps-china-propaganda-2020-5">kind words for Xi Jinping</a>. As long as the trade deal on which he was hanging his political aspirations was in play Trump was willing to bargain. And based on Bolton's telling, Xi knew that that bargaining could eased along with flattery too. It's hard to imagine an easier mark.</p><p>Trump's cabinet and allies must know that he has no real policy goals, just a desire to give his base what they want so he can have what he wants — another win. Perhaps that why, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pompeo-spreads-wuhan-lab-coronavirus-conspiracy-get-trump-attention-2020-5">as I posited in May</a>, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was running around the country spreading the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus had escaped from a Chinese lab. The hawks, like Pompeo, know Trump has no real real ideological issue with China, so they wanted to rile him up just as they were riling up his base. They needed to tie their own policy goals to his desire for reelection.</p>



<p>In other words, just <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-wants-trump-win-election-keep-destroying-us-alliances-bloomberg-2020-6">like Xi Jinping,</a> those around him see Trump as a tool that they can manipulate through flattery, or by appearing on his favorite TV shows. Once you know he's motivated solely by reelection, it's easy to maneuver the American president. He has no real values, certainly not the ones this country espouses.</p><p>In fact, according to Bolton, Trump told Xi over dinner that "people are saying" this country should abolish term limits for him just like China did for Xi Jinping.</p><p>That's not a hawk, that's not a dove, that's a dictator.</p>
