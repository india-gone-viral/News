</ul><hr></hr><p>The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/nasdaq_100?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nasdaq 100</a> surged to a new intraday record in Thursday trading, becoming the first major US stock index to retrace its coronavirus decline.</p>
<p>The 100-stock index reached an intraday high of 9,741.97 at 10:32 a.m. ET before retreating with its peer indexes as the day's rally paused. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ebay-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a> led the Nasdaq's run-up, leaping as much as 9.8% after revealing strong demand through the second quarter and boosting its profit guidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ual-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Airlines</a> rallied as much as 17% through the day, though its lower weighting in the Nasdaq 100 stifled its contribution to the upswing.
</p>



<p>In all, the index rocketed more than 43% in about two-and-a-half months to eclipse its February 19 highs.</p>

<p>Soaring tech mega-caps fueled much of the index's recovery as investors piled into popular firms through April and May. The FAANG coalition - <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/fb-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google - all leaped over recent months as traders bet on stay-at-home trends to boost tech names. Their gains through earnings season contributed to the Nasdaq composite <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nasdaq-composite-erases-2020-losses-strong-tech-earnings-stock-market-2020-4-1029178443?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erasing all year-to-date losses</a> in early May.</p>
<p>Peer indexes didn't fare as well in Thursday's session. The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dow_jones?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dow Jones industrial average</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S&P 500</a> opened slightly lower before paring losses and trading mostly unchanged through the morning.</p>

The Labor Department announced Thursday morning <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-filings-millions-layoffs-continue-coronavirus-2020-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week</a>, bringing the metric's 11-week total to nearly 43 million. Continuing claims stood flat at 21.5 million, stymieing some hopes of a rapid labor-market recovery.
