<p>Some Las Vegas casinos and hotels opened their doors Thursday as Nevada continued its second stage of reopening — and at least one casino was packed with people ignoring social-distancing guidelines.</p><p>In order to reopen, casinos <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-casinos-reopen-masks-shields-social-distancing-2020-6">need to submit a plan</a> to the Nevada Gaming Control Board detailing how they intend to keep proper hygiene and social distancing. MGM Resorts-owned Bellagio and New York-New York, among other casinos, planned to increase cleaning, require employees to wear masks, and maintain social distancing. But when the doors opened, some casinos proved better than others at maintaining safety protocols.</p><p>The gaming floor of The D, a popular casino in downtown Las Vegas, was swarmed with people in the early hours of the casino's reopening. A video of the gaming floor posted by Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Mick Akers shows crowds too close-knit to be able to maintain social distancing, although dealers and dancers can be seen wearing masks.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Mick Akers  (@mickakers) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1268439955212079104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>A spokesperson for The D Las Vegas could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>



<p>Many customers also disregarded spacing at slot machines — not leaving an empty spot between themselves and other players.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Mick Akers  (@mickakers) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1268477813482352640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>However, surfaces appeared to be regularly cleaned.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Mick Akers  (@mickakers) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1268470653474070528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>The Fremont Hotel & Casino also seemed to struggle to keep patrons socially distanced.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Jeff Hwang  (@RivalSchoolX) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1268450012213637120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>A spokesperson for The Fremont Hotel & Casino could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>While some casinos were packed on the first day of reopening, others saw a weaker turnout.</p>

Hello Vegas." The resort later changed the ad. A Wynn representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Nevada <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Press-release-Phase-One-Industry-Specific-Guidance.pdf">began Phase 1</a> of reopening May 9 with <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Roadmap-to-Recovery-Phase-One-Initial-Guidance.pdf">restaurants and hair salons</a>. <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="http://gov.nv.gov/News/Press/2020/Governor_Sisolak_Releases_Prepared_Remarks,_Guidance_for_Phase_2_Reopening,_Plans_Press_Call/">Gyms and fitness facilities</a> were allowed to open during <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRESS-RELEASE-Phase-2-Directive-Guidance.pdf">Phase 2 which began May 29</a>.
