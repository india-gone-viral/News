<p>With just three days until President Donald Trump is scheduled to take the stage in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for his first rally since the coronavirus pandemic shut down most of the US, details on the safety of the event are hard to come by.</p><p>While attendees sign a <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://events.donaldjtrump.com/events/tulsa-oklahoma-rally-june-20">waiver</a> absolving the campaign and venue of liability if they contract COVID-19, Trump's campaign, the company that manages the venue, and city officials wouldn't answer whether event staff would do the same, or offer specifics on how employees working the event would be protected.</p><p>The campaign rally is supposed to take place Saturday night at the BOK Center, a 19,000-seat indoor arena that is blocks from the site of the <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/near-trumps-rally-site-black-tulsa-lives-with-fiery-legacy-2020-6">1921 Tulsa massacre that destroyed Black Wall Street</a> and killed 300 Black Tulsans.</p><p>The rally, which is the president's first since his <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?469845-1/president-trump-campaigns-charlotte-north-carolina">March 2 event in Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, was initially scheduled for Friday, though the president moved it to Saturday <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pushed-back-tulsa-rally-wouldnt-coincide-juneteenth-2020-6">because it conflicted with Juneteenth</a>, the June 19 holiday that recognizes the end of slavery in the US.</p><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="tulsa massacre 1921 black wall street" data-content-type="image/jpeg" data-srcs="{"https://i.insider.com/5eea3703988ee3232c0ad0d5":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","aspectRatioW":2000,"aspectRatioH":1333}}" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></img>

</figure></p><p>On Monday, Business Insider requested information from representatives for the BOK Center about who was staffing the rally and whether any private security contractors would be used at the event. On Tuesday, Meghan Blood, a spokeswoman for the ASM Global, the company that manages the venue, told Business Insider that the venue was proceeding with the rally because doing so was allowed under Oklahoma <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.okcommerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/Open-Up-and-Recover-Safely-Plan.pdf">"Open Up and Recover Safely" (OURS) guidelines</a>.</p>



<p>"Government officials have advised that the campaign rally as planned is consistent with the guidance for the OURS plan for entertainment venues, however, in the event that the governing authorities impose new restrictions, we will notify the event organizers immediately," she said.</p><p><a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.okcommerce.gov/wp-content/uploads/Entertainment-and-Sporting-Venue-Guidance.pdf">State guidelines for entertainment venues</a> read "business owners and event organizers should use their best judgement taking into account factors such as location and size of venue when determining the appropriate levels of social distancing and group size."</p><p>In a separate message, Blood told Business Insider that any questions about venue security should be directed toward the president's campaign. While the BOK Center typically uses private security, on Wednesday she said security at the rally would be "taken care of by secret service." Multiple attempts to reach the Trump campaign went unanswered.</p><h2>Concession stands will be open during the rally and attendees won't be required to wear masks</h2><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="bok center trump rally tulsa oklahoma" data-content-type="image/jpeg" data-srcs="{"https://i.insider.com/5eea93672618b952ae746566":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","aspectRatioW":2500,"aspectRatioH":1667}}" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></img>

</figure></p><p>Vendors and the <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="http://www.bokcenter.com/experience-arena/#!/concessions/">concession stands</a> will be open during the event, Blood said, adding that workers "will be making sure to follow current CDC guidelines."</p>

Employee temperature screenings and necessary personal protective equipment for employees will be enforced. Additional hand sanitizer stations and increased cleaning of high-touch areas will also be conducted."</p>



<p>Michelle Brooks, a spokesperson for the city of Tulsa, which owns the BOK Center, told Business Insider to send its staffing questions to Blood. While the city owns the BOK Center, she said employees of the venue were not considered employees of the city of Tulsa.</p><p>Brooks said questions about local law enforcement presence at the Saturday event should be directed to the Tulsa Police Department, which told Business Insider it did not have any information to release about the Saturday event. The Department <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/TulsaPolice/status/1273000895199010816">tweeted</a> Tuesday it was working with Secret Service and other agencies to plan for the president's visit, including any <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/TulsaPolice/status/1271193981603524610/photo/3">counter-protests</a>.</p><p>The city will not bill the campaign for costs such as police overtime and traffic control, Brooks told reporter Dave Levinthal.</p><blockquote data-cards="" data-conversation="" data-lang="en">—Dave Levinthal  (@davelevinthal) <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1273315352743677954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2020</a></blockquote><h2>Rally-goers are asked to waive their right to sue the BOK Center and Trump campaign if they contract COVID-19</h2><p>Rally attendees are asked to sign a waiver <a data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" href="https://events.donaldjtrump.com/events/tulsa-oklahoma-rally-june-19">before registering for the event</a> that would prevent them from taking legal action against either the Trump campaign or the BOK Center if they contracted COVID-19 at the rally. The Trump campaign, BOK Center, and the city of Tulsa did not say whether any security or other employees working at the event would have to make a similar agreement.</p>



<p>"By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present," the disclaimer read.</p><p>On its website, the BOK Center said it would check attendees <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/temperature-checks-flawed-coronavirus-cases-asymptomatic-no-fever-2020-5">temperatures</a> upon entry and provide masks. But attendees <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/masks-will-be-optional-at-trumps-oklahoma-rally-as-covid-19-spikes-2020-6">won't be required to wear them</a>, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhVXk1wm4c">Fox News</a> on Monday.</p><p><a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/sites/g/files/gmc786/f/052820-food-establishment-reopening_final-eng.pdf">Current Oklahoma guidelines</a> recommend — but don't require — that "outdoor and enclosed large venues such as ballparks and arenas should maintain spaced seating between groups that do not share a household such as every other row empty, staggered seating, or at least two seats empty between parties."</p><p>It's unclear if the BOK Center will stagger seating or reduce capacity to follow the state health department's guidelines.</p>



<p><a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1272521253136498690">While the president tweeted nearly a million people had expressed interest in attending the rally</a>, Tulsa officials have <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/tulsa-mayor-says-any-rational-person-would-have-coronavirus-concerns-n1231297">said they expect about 100,000</a>. The BOK Center has a capacity of just over 19,000. <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.insider.com/tiktok-users-trolling-trump-requesting-tickets-to-his-rally-2020-6">Social media users have apparently registered for the free event in an effort to troll the president</a>, so it's unclear how many actually plan to attend.

</figure></p><p>Wednesday marked the <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oklahoma-reports-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-before-trumps-tulsa-rally-2020-6">single biggest daily increase</a> in the number of new COVID-19 since the pandemic began in the state of Oklahoma with 259 new COVID-19 cases.</p><p>The majority of COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma have been in Tulsa County, according to <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://looker-dashboards.ok.gov/embed/dashboards/44">the state department of health</a>. Tulsa County also hit a new high on Wednesday with 96 new reported cases of the disease.</p>



<p>"The risk certainly applies to everyone present at the location: attendees organizers, staff, security people, and everybody who is inside," William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, told Business Insider. "Even people working outside to keep lines orderly and provide security — they are going to have a lot of close contact. Maybe less than they would if they were inside, but nonetheless they'll have a lot of exposure."</p><p>Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Bruce Dart, who did not return Business Insider's request for comment, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/tulsa-health-department-director-wishes-trump-rally-would-be-postponed-as-local-covid-cases-surge/article_bac51435-a5d0-5b5c-ba74-182047453d53.html">told Tulsa World he would prefer that the president's rally be rescheduled</a>.</p><p>"I think it's an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic," Dart said. "I'm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I'm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well."</p><p>G.T. Bynum, the city's Republican mayor, has said he's anxious about the upcoming rally but said he would not use his power, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/tulsa-mayor-g-t-bynum-says-he-wont-attempt-to-block-trump-rally/article_20185283-9516-5948-aa11-9a47b4d558ad.html">Tulsa World</a> reported.</p>



<p>"Do I share anxiety about having a full house at the BOK Center? Of course," Bynum said. "As someone who is cautious by nature, I don't like to be the first to try anything. I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already."</p><p>On Wednesday, Bynum told reporters he would not say whether he believed the president's rally would be "safe" but said it wasn't his "decision to make" about whether to postpone the rally, <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://twitter.com/KOCODillon/status/1273311992422576128">according to KOCO reporter Dillon Richards</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hundreds-of-oklahoma-nurses-and-doctors-urge-mayor-to-cancel-trumps-tulsa-rally-2020-6">Hundreds of Oklahoma nurses and doctors have urged leaders to cancel Trump's Tulsa rally over</a> concerns it will be a superspreader event.</p><p>A Tulsa judge on Tuesday declined to issue a temporary injunction against the rally that city residents and business owners had requested, according to the <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/oklahoma-lawsuit-tries-to-block-trumps-rally-because-of-coronavirus-fears/2020/06/16/175bbf30-b01f-11ea-a567-6172530208bd_story.html">Washington Post.</a></p><section data-source="coronavirus-news-to-read-updates-2020-3"><p><svg aria-labelledby="title desc" height="50" role="img" space="preserve" style="enable-background:new 0 0 50 50;" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 50 50" width="50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title id="title">Loading</title><desc id="desc">Something is loading.</desc><path d="M43.935,25.145c0-10.318-8.364-18.683-18.683-18.683c-10.318,0-18.683,8.365-18.683,18.683h4.068c0-8.071,6.543-14.615,14.615-14.615c8.072,0,14.615,6.543,14.615,14.615H43.935z" fill="#111"><animatetransform attributename="transform" attributetype="xml" dur="0.6s" from="0 25 25" repeatcount="indefinite" to="360 25 25" type="rotate"></animatetransform></path></svg></p>
