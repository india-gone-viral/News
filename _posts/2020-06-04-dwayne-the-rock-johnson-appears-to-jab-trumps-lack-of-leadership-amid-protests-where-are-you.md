I’ve got you. I’ve got you, I hear you, I’m listening to you and you have my word that I’m going to do everything in my power, till my dying day, to my last breath to do everything I can to create the change that’s needed, to normalize equality because black lives matter.’”</p><div source=""><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" ><source media="(min-width: 767px)" ><img alt="Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shared an impassioned speech seemingly calling on Donald Trump to show compassion amid the ongoing protests. " src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/06/640/320/TheRockTrump1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"></img></source></source></picture></div><p>
      Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shared an impassioned speech seemingly calling on Donald Trump to show compassion amid the ongoing protests.

All lives matter because we, as Americans, believe in inclusivity, we believe in acceptance, we believe in human rights, we believe in equality for all,” Johnson explained. “That’s what we believe in, so of course all lives matter, but in this moment right now, this defining pivotal, explosive moment where our country is down on its knees, the floorboards of our country are becoming unhinged in this moment, we must say the words ‘black lives matter.’”</p><p>The star went on to denounce the use of military force on protesters, arguing that treating the moment with compassion would yield more positive, long-term results.</p><p>“There is military force that has been deployed on our own people. Looters? Yes. Criminals? Absolutely. But our protesters who are begging and pleading, our protesters who are in pain…. You know you would be surprised how people in pain would respond when you say to them ‘I care about you.’ When you say to them ‘I’m listening to you.’ You’d be surprised how people would respond — how Americans would respond.”</p><p><a href="https://WWW.FOXNEWS.COM/HEALTH/PREGNANT-WOMEN-RISK-CORONAVIRUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ARE PREGNANT WOMEN AT RISK FOR CORONAVIRUS?</strong></a></p><p>The star concluded by once more asking for America’s leader to step up before urging citizens to take leadership into their own hands if the president continues to demonstrate a combative response to the protests.</p><p>“So, as we continue to wait for that leader to emerge... I would recommend to all of you that we must become the leaders we’re looking for. We can become our own leaders, because we’re doing it now. We’re doing it now,” he said. “We must become the leaders that we’re looking for. I’ll ask it one more time… Where are you? Where is that compassionate leader who steps up and takes accountability for his country and all of the people in our country? Where are you? Because, I tell you what, we’re here, we are all here. We’re all here. And the process to change has already begun.”</p><p><strong><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p>He concluded his lengthy video saying: “You can feel it across our country, change is happening. It’s going to take time. We’re going to get beat up, we’re going to take our lumps, there’s going to be blood but the process of change has already begun. You guys stay strong.
