Unfortunately, vitamin D is one of the more elusive vitamins. It's not found in high concentrations in many foods, and many people miss out on the one big opportunity to get vitamin D -- sun exposure -- because they're stuck inside their workplaces all day.</p><p>Thus, vitamin D deficiency <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26877203/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">is a worldwide problem</a>.</p><p>If you think you might have vitamin D deficiency, you should ask your doctor for a test to confirm. You could also try an <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/8-at-home-health-kits-to-test-for-celiac-disease-fertility-and-more/">at-home test</a></span> for vitamin D deficiency, but it's up to you to do your research on the testing company and make sure it meets lab safety, accuracy and efficacy standards.</p><div data-track="newsletter" section="subscribeNewsletter">

</div><p>Whether or not you get tested, if you decide to take a vitamin D supplement, be careful not to exceed the "tolerable upper intake level" (UL), which is the maximum intake known to be safe. The <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UL for vitamin D</a> is 100 micrograms (mcg) or 4,000 international units (IU) per day for adults. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) is far below that at <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">15 mcg or 600 IU per day</a> for adults ages 18-70.</p><p>Too much vitamin D from supplements can lead to <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">vitamin D toxicity</a> -- something clinicians are beginning to see more often because of vitamin D's skyrocketing popularity as a supplement. </p><p>Either way, before you start spending money on a <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/should-you-take-vitamins-what-to-know-before-you-buy/">supplement that may or may not work</a></span>, you can try these six tactics for getting more vitamin D. </p><h2>1. Open your office, home or car window</h2><figure section="shortcodeImage"><span><span><img alt="living area with natural light interior shot" data-original="https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/Ezo0g-fBqHNT7veoxpyXAlKO-E8=/2020/06/02/48a0a3cd-6c31-4deb-b484-3e899b3e8c62/gettyimages-1156011692.jpg" src="http://www.cnet.com/"></img></span></span><figcaption><span><p>Let some sunlight into your home, office or car.</p></span><span>

                                                </span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not your windows block UV <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19614895/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">depends on what kind of windows you have</a>. Standard windows, according to the International Ultraviolet Association, do allow <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://www.iuva.org/UV-FAQs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UV-A rays, but not UV-B rays, to pass through</a>. </p><p>Most windows in homes and buildings are treated in some way, such as with a window film or tint, that blocks both types of UV light from passing through. Since that's likely the case in your home or office (and possibly your car), opening the window can help you get more sunlight.</p><p>Just be sure to wear sunscreen of at least 15 SPF if you'll have the window open for a long time, as well as UV-blocking glasses or sunglasses if you're directly facing the open window. If it's super sunny outside, you may not need to open the window for more than 10 to 15 minutes to increase your vitamin D production.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-get-enough-vitamin-c-for-immune-support/">Vitamin C: Why you need it and how to get enough</a></span></p><h2>2. Drink your first cup of coffee outside</h2><figure section="shortcodeImage"><span><span><img alt="gettyimages-993733394" data-original="https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/SFkI9FKm4-VGwP5yoXRkdoSe-Cc=/2020/06/02/1e0087f1-c10a-4369-9749-b4dc07d491d7/gettyimages-993733394.jpg" src="http://www.cnet.com/"></img></span></span><figcaption><span><p>We don't all have views this great, but drinking your morning beverage outside can still be peaceful (and aid in vitamin D production!).</p></span><span>

Morning light isn't as harsh as sunlight later in the day, but you can still meet at least some of your vitamin D needs this way.</p><p>If you work from home, try doing this before you sit down at your desk (you can totally still take a second cup for your initial stretch of computer work though). If you work at an office or another workplace, you might have to set your alarm a few minutes earlier to enjoy the morning light. </p><p>Before you cringe at the thought of an <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-become-a-morning-person-according-to-sleep-experts/">earlier wake-up time</a></span>, know that you'll get more benefits than just the vitamin D absorption.</p><p><span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/start-your-day-like-a-boss-8-tips-for-being-more-productive-every-morning/">Carving out time for yourself</a></span> in the morning, even as little as 10 to 15 minutes, can have a positive impact on your day. You may find yourself looking forward to your early morning coffee because it's a time for you to slow down, be with your thoughts and set your intentions for the day.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/is-caffeine-really-bad-for-you/">Is caffeine actually bad for you?

Replace some meat with fish</h2><figure section="shortcodeImage"><span><span><img alt="salmon on top of salad vitamin D food sources" data-original="https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/60XI1wc3MTb4HfePgXiv2ieFnF0=/2020/06/02/7e055458-d0bb-4be7-b6a6-1f1d25beb553/gettyimages-1148856860.jpg" src="http://www.cnet.com/"></img></span></span><figcaption><span><p>Fish are one of the best food sources of vitamin D.</p></span><span>

Eat the whole egg</h2><figure section="shortcodeImage"><span><span><img alt="gettyimages-100003456" data-original="https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/hGsAFxrIuv0JnMdb34t8VgfFhXI=/2020/06/02/6f6b67d8-2500-4e92-8d7a-c0408c84588a/gettyimages-100003456.jpg" src="http://www.cnet.com/"></img></span></span><figcaption><span><p>Egg yolks are a good source of vitamin D.</p></span><span>

                                                </span></figcaption></figure><p>While most adults today grew up hearing that eggs were bad for their heart, that <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/common-health-myths-you-need-to-stop-believing-right-now/">myth</a></span> has since been disproven (see <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/104/21/1756" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/107/6/921/4992612" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126094/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6626779/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>) and it turns out that <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eggs</a> are one of the few food sources that naturally contain vitamin D. </p><p>You have to eat the whole egg, though: The yolks are where the vitamin D lives. Eggs alone aren't enough to meet the daily vitamin D requirement, but they're a healthy, protein-packed way to help get there. Interestingly but not surprisingly, free-range eggs <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24607306/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">contain more vitamin D</a> than conventional eggs.</p><h2>5. Take a lunchtime walk </h2><figure section="shortcodeImage"><span><span><img alt="gettyimages-592012779" data-original="https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/kEfHO69EDKo0Z2CxTRcl34ZlBJ0=/2020/03/04/5e6b43bb-c3b8-46a7-9979-1fd879237724/gettyimages-592012779.jpg" src="http://www.cnet.com/"></img></span></span><figcaption><span><p>Taking walks outside is a great way to get more vitamin D.</p></span><span>

Most people already don't get enough sun, and <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/best-sunscreen-for-2020-neutrogena-eltamd-supergoop-and-more/">sunscreen</a></span> prevents your skin from absorbing UV light, which is paradoxically responsible for both skin cancer and converting vitamin D into its active form. </p><p>You might wonder what a person is to do. Since the bulk of most people's vitamin D comes from casual exposure to the sun, taking a walk at lunch could provide for most of your vitamin D needs. In fact, <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20072137/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one study</a> done in the UK found that less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure is enough to maintain sufficient blood levels of vitamin D in healthy adults.</p><p>Going for a walk at lunch can give you the best bang for your buck because midday sunlight is stronger than morning light but not as strong as afternoon light -- meaning you can go out and get your vitamin D with a <a data-component="externalLink" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18348449/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lower risk of sun damage</a>. Plus, you'll get some light exercise in and return to work feeling refreshed.</p><p>If you have a family history of skin cancer or other skin health complications that may be exacerbated by sun exposure, you should continue to follow any safety protocols given to you by your doctor. </p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/skincare-basics-the-only-products-you-really-need-for-better-skin-this-year/">Skincare 101: The only products you need to get good skin</a></span></p>
