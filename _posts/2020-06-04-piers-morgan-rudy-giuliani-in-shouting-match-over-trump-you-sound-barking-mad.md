      Rudy Giuliani told Piers Morgan he was using politically correct propaganda to gain popularity during a heated argument.
      </p></div><p>A frustrated Morgan responded as Giuliani kept talking over him. “I’m up here at 1 in the morning to answer your questions, I would think you’d give me the courtesy of answering, I know you don’t like my answers,” the former New York City mayor said.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/andy-ngo-liberal-media-antifa-conservatives-didnt-take-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANDY NGO: LIBERAL MEDIA ‘HAS MANY SYMPATHIES’ TOWARD ANTIFA, CONSERVATIVES DIDN’T TAKE THREATS SERIOUSLY</a></strong></p><p>Morgan repeatedly tried to intervene but Giuliani continued to speak over him until he finally said, “Rudy, I’m sorry but you’re talking total crap.”</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-seeks-to-clarify-tweet-minneapolis-looting-leads-to-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRUMP SEEKS TO CLARIFY TWEET ON MINNEAPOLIS: 'LOOTING LEADS TO SHOOTING'</a></strong></p><p>“You keep saying it’s the left-wing media that has somehow misquoted Donald Trump. The president of the United States’ job, when this kind of thing happens is to keep temperatures down. Not to put fuel on the fire,” Morgan said, which Giuliani didn’t appreciate, and the bickering immediately grew louder.</p><p>Giuliani asked, “Did you want me on here to ask me questions, or did you want me on so you could make a political propaganda point?”</p><p>Morgan told Giuliani he was guilty of that himself. “You said the whole thing was a left-wing myth, everyone’s got it in for poor old Donald Trump,” he said.</p><p><strong><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p>Giuliani then said, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts” is an accurate statement and the two shouted at each other for several more minutes.</p><p>“Rudy, What happened to you?
