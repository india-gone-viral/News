Moat eventually shot himself after a six-hour stand-off with police seven days later.</p> <p>Transfixed, Katelaine listened to the voice of the father who had always refused to accept or even meet her.</p> <section data-ad-dockable="true" data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2"></section><p>Almost 10 years from Moat’s rampage in July 2010, the 21-year-old is bravely giving her first in-depth interview.</p> <p>Speaking from her home near Newcastle, the emotions Katelaine still wrestles with – shame, disgust, abandonment – are painfully clear.</p> <p>She says: “I’m so sorry to the people he has hurt. If I had the chance to meet the victims and their families and say I’m so sorry for what my dad did, and show that I care, I would.”</p>  <p>Katelaine, who has Moat’s strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes, adds: “Being his flesh and blood sickens me at times, it’s hard to believe who I am.</p> <p>“I can’t believe I come from that man.</p> <p>“I’m so glad I didn’t know him, and that I became the person I am today despite all I have been through.”</p> <p>She was relentlessly bullied through school, taunted for her physical similarity to her biological father.</p> <p>Yet with moving honesty, Katelaine admits she still, in a way, yearns for the dad she never knew.</p> <p>She writes him a birthday card each year on June 17, poignantly close to Father’s Day – then she burns it and releases a balloon to float away.</p> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article12115925.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS67150592.jpg" itemprop="url"></meta><meta content="615" itemprop="width"></meta><meta content="440" itemprop="height"></meta><div>

</figcaption></figure><p>Stumbling to explain, she says: “It is not about honouring him. It is not for him, but for me, for my peace of mind.</p> <p>“I do a little speech in my head. One year it might be: ‘I hope you’re proud of me despite everything you have done.’ Other times I have thought: ‘Why couldn’t you just be the right person? Do the right thing?’”</p> <p>She still sounds heartbreakingly like that little girl desperate to hear her dad’s voice, and agrees her feelings are confusingly “love, hate”. Recently, she was playing with a social media app that swaps the sex of people in photos.</p> <p>Blinking her piercing blue eyes, she admits the result was horrifying.</p> <p>“I did it and oh my God, I regretted it so much,” she says.</p> <p>“I showed my mum and she nearly had a heart attack. I looked like 18-year-old Raoul Moat.”</p> <p>Katelaine thought her mum Caroline’s ex-partner was her dad, until a relative told her the truth when she was around seven. Caroline, who had hoped to protect her, was then honest, explaining her real father “had been a good man, but the drugs and stuff had taken over”.</p> <p>In fact, Katelaine was to learn her mum had suffered attacks by Moat after they met in 1996.</p> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article10775579.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/CY35307841.jpg" itemprop="url"></meta><meta content="615" itemprop="width"></meta><meta content="461" itemprop="height"></meta><div>

I was playing out, Mum shouted us in and said: ‘I dreaded this moment, we need to leave the area.’ I remember some fear, being very still, thinking about it, ‘Is this really happening?’”</p> <p>With a police escort, they headed to relatives in the Midlands.</p> <p>Eluding police, on July 4 Moat shot PC Rathband, 42, as he sat in his patrol car, leaving him permanently blinded. The officer committed suicide two years later.</p> <p>Katelaine remembers vividly Moat ending his life, as the stand-off was broadcast on rolling TV news a week later.</p> <p>“I watched it,” she says, bluntly, although says she can’t recall the emotions she felt at the time. “Everyone instantly looked at me and Mum cried.”</p> <p>At the end of that summer she started secondary school though the timing was terrible.</p> <p>She recalls: “I was targeted. People would be like ‘You’re Raoul Moat’s daughter’.” She began truanting.</p> <p>At the end of Year Nine when a teacher confronted her, she lashed out and got excluded from the school.</p> <p>In the behavioural school she went to next, she punched a child.</p> <p>Katelaine explained: “He came walking towards me punching the wall and he goes ‘Ha, this is your dad’s face’.</p> <p>“I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and punched him in the face.</p> <p>“I was so sick of hearing it, all the time.”</p>   <p>But her new school and her mum gave Katelaine the support she needed.</p> <p> Despite suffering depression, she is now settled in a happy relationship and hopes to work as a carer. <br></br><a alt="Ad options" href="http://" id="div-gpt-ad-in-article-slot-ad-menu-nav" rel="nofollow" title="Ad options"></a></p> <p>Over the past four years she has built a friendship with two of Moat’s other children, the daughters of another of his abused exes.</p> <p>She says of Moat: “He has made some really good people despite the man he was – it’s probably the one good thing he did in his entire life.”</p></div><br/><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/raoul-moat-daughter-speaks-anniversary-18456603" class="button purchase" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read More</a>
