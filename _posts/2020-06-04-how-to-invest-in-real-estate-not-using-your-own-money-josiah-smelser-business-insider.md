<p>Before <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.instagram.com/dailyrealestateinvestor/?hl=en">Josiah Smelser</a> — a successful real-estate investor and host of "<a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-real-estate-investor/id1441836641">The Daily Real Estate Investor</a>" — started his scooping up his first properties, his main source of income came from a career in accounting.</p><p>That didn't last long.</p><p>"Absolutely hated it," he said on the "<a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast">BiggerPockets Podcast</a>." "I couldn't stand the sitting-in-a-cubicle thing."</p><p>The distaste for a traditional 9-to-5 job led Smelser to pursue a business venture appraising houses with a close friend. Eventually, that experience led him into the investment arena, and he started purchasing properties in 2005.</p>



<p>But that initial journey into real-estate investing was relatively short lived. After a few successful deals, he divested his properties to hike 1,100 miles of the Appalachian trail.</p><p>"Right before the market crashed I — dumb luck — just unloaded everything," he said. "I had a lot of equity in the properties I had, and looking back on it, I really wish I'd held on to everything."</p><p>When Smelser's epic hike from Georgia to Pennsylvania was complete, he found himself getting the real-estate itch again — and he set his sights on a two-family fixer-upper. It was primed for a so-called house hack. </p><p>For the uninitiated, house-hacking is a real-estate investment strategy that uses the extra rooms or units of your primary residence. A house-hacker can cover costs associated with the property and even generate positive income by renting out these spaces.</p>



<p>It's a strategy that 27-year-old entrepreneur <a data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investing-house-hacking-strategy-financial-independence-craig-curelop-2020-2">Craig Curelop</a> used to eliminate $90,000 worth of student-loan debt and achieve financial freedom. Curelop said "it's hard not to get rich" with the methodology.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and Smelser has divested his multifamily house-hack and rolled that cash into other real-estate investing ventures. In total, he's scooped up a little under $4 million of deals in less than 12 months time. </p><p>Here's the strategy he's employed to turn that initial cash into a small empire.</p><h3>A creative strategy</h3><p>At the heart of Smelser's investment approach lies the "BRRRR" strategy.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, BRRRR stands for <strong>buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat. </strong></p><p>Traditionally, investors employing the BRRRR strategy acquire the initial loan to purchase a property from a conventional lender, and fund the down payment themselves. However, Smelser differentiates himself by purchasing his properties with 100% outside funds. By doing so, he frees up cash that can be deployed if an appraisal comes in low or if repairs wind up costing more than anticipated.</p><p>But before Smelser even thinks of purchasing a property, he runs a slew of numbers to ensure the deal is worth taking. He starts for what he can sell the property for — commonly known as the <strong>after repair value</strong>, or "ARV" for short — vets comparables (similar properties that have recently sold), and works his way backwards to arrive at his estimates.</p><p>"So I'm buying the property with 100% of other people's money," he said. "I'll buy the property with hard money  — and they'll give me a 90% loan-to-cost alone on the property — and then I'll use the 10% equity that's being brought in from my private money lender."</p>



<p>Here's how it works. Smelser provided an estimated breakdown of a typical purchase.</p><p><strong>Purchase price</strong> — $105,000</p><p><strong>Closing costs</strong> — $5,000</p><p><strong>AVR</strong> — $200,000 </p>



<p>Smelser knows he needs to be all-in (total cost) to the property for $150,000, which equates to the amount of cash he'll be able to pull out of the property from the subsequent refinance (75% of AVR). Since he's already on the hook for $110,000, he knows he can spend up to $40,000 for repairs and holding costs.</p><p>Here's how he finances the deal.</p><p><strong>Hard money lender 90%</strong> — $135,000</p><p><strong>Private money lender 10%</strong> — $15,000</p>



<p><strong>Total owed</strong> — $150,000</p><p>If all goes according to plan, the property will appraise for $200,000 and Smelser will be able to pull out $150,000 worth of cash upon the refinance. His hard money and private lenders are then promptly paid back, and he's left with a property that's primed to cash flow. </p><p>As a general rule of thumb, Smelser aims to generate $200 of cash flow per unit.</p><p>Clearly, Smelser's strategy relies heavily on the AVR — and that's why he puts so much time and energy into ensuring that his fixed-up property will appraise as he expected.</p>



<p>"The investors that I look up to the most, they're not taking reckless risk; but they're setting big goals; and they're taking big steps to get there; and they're getting big results " he added in a follow up interview with Business Insider. "Think bigger — and back into the steps you need to take to make that big goal happen."</p>
