<div><p>Some personality traits may be linked to certain pre-dementia conditions, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> concluded.</p><p>Researchers recently published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society a study that looked at five personality traits — neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness — and their link to certain pre-dementia conditions, namely motoric cognitive risk (MCR), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277675/#:~:text=The%20motoric%20cognitive%20risk%20syndrome,without%20dementia%20or%20mobility%20disability.">which is characterized by</a> “the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait in older individuals without dementia or mobility disability," and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndromes, or a “slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills,” as defined by the<a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/related_conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment#:~:text=Mild%20Cognitive%20Impairment%20(MCI),developing%20Alzheimer's%20or%20another%20dementia."> Alzheimer's Association. </a></p><p>The study involved 524 adults in Westchester County, New York, who were over the age of 65 and had not been diagnosed with dementia at the beginning of the study. The participants were observed for three years, after which time 38 of them developed MCR, while 69 developed MCI, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.16424">according to the study.</a></p><div source=""><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" ><source media="(min-width: 767px)" ><img alt="Openness was associated with a 6 percent reduced risk of developing MCR, the study found." src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/06/640/320/iStock-1089332974.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"></img></source></source></picture></div><p>
      Openness was associated with a 6 percent reduced risk of developing MCR, the study found.
