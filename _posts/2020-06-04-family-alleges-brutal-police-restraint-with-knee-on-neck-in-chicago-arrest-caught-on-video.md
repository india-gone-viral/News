Wright was charged with disorderly conduct and released Monday, according to police and the family.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> A video of part of the incident was taken by family friend James Smith, 40, who was driving in a second car. A copy of the video was first published by the nonprofit digital news organization<a href="https://t.co/jhGUwTaZy0%20https://t.co/BEzHB3OVEX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Block Club Chicago</a>, and Smith provided the Tribune with a copy later Wednesday.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> “She never resisted. It could have been something deadly,” Tate told the Tribune on Wednesday.</p></div> <div data-type="image"> <div> <figure class="" data-trk-photo-credit="Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune"><p><img alt="Mia Wright, center, stands next to her cousin Tnika Tate with Wright's mother, Kim Woods, in the background on June 3, 2020." data-src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/kpNL5qRqJgJZrfBNfUSj0rlk3bQ=/1400x0/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/GNSWQHTB3ZALVODEC3FBJ77B74.jpg" data-src-medium="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/6DgiLuvXzmFV5gloDW0Vm-KUqQc=/800x533/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/GNSWQHTB3ZALVODEC3FBJ77B74.jpg" data-src-mobile="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/UZaoZqPTe3Slejf0M79OEXe0Vtk=/415x276/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/GNSWQHTB3ZALVODEC3FBJ77B74.jpg" data-src-small="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/UZaoZqPTe3Slejf0M79OEXe0Vtk=/415x276/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/GNSWQHTB3ZALVODEC3FBJ77B74.jpg" src="/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif"></img></p> <figcaption><p> Mia Wright, center, stands next to her cousin Tnika Tate with Wright's mother, Kim Woods, in the background on June 3, 2020. <span>(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</span></p> </figcaption></figure></div></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Wright declined to comment. The use of kneeling to restrain someone in police custody has been under scrutiny nationwide since George Floyd died after being held down by an officer in Minneapolis who used his knee to restrain Floyd.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Police spokeswoman Kellie Bartoli said Wright was placed into custody and charged with disorderly conduct after she was observed by responding officers “assembled with three or more persons for the purpose of using force or violence to disturb the peace.” </p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class="" data-item-id="depth_scroll_middle" data-item-number="middle" data-item-type="depthscroll"> In a statement, police added: “The Chicago Police Department strives to treat all individuals our officers encounter with respect. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated by a CPD officer is encouraged to call 311 and file a complaint with the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, who will investigate allegations of misconduct. Misconduct on the part of our officers will not be tolerated.”</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Ephraim Eddy, a spokesman for COPA, said in an email that the agency had “received a complaint regarding this incident and has opened an investigation to determine the if the actions of involved officers are within Department policy. We encourage anyone with information to contact our office at 312-746-3609 or visit our website at <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchicagocopa.org%2F&data=02%7C01%7Clford%40chicagotribune.com%7C414397ee7f47424c8c3308d8080b512d%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C637268191987785873&sdata=EbFnd5CFT1birw1z09Rf12XieSIFmWYysaYdHmOTnEo%3D&reserved=0" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ChicagoCOPA.org</a>.”</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Tate, a manager at a South Side funeral parlor, said she was driving three relatives and a friend to the Brickyard Mall when they discovered that the mall had been closed because of looting. Smith was with them in a second car.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Tate said she pulled over, and her car was suddenly surrounded by police. Officers broke at least three of the car’s windows with batons, according to Take and the video, and pulled some occupants out of the vehicle.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Tate and other relatives said police handcuffed Wright, then took her to a clinic to remove glass debris from her eye.</p></div>  <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> Wright’s mother, Kim Woods, a longtime secretary at Dett Elementary School on the Near West Side, was one of the passengers in the car. She said police did not release Wright from the Grand Central Police District station until 10:45 the following Monday morning.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p> “Her eye was swollen. It has been traumatizing,” Woods said.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p class=""> <i>Chicago Tribune’s Jessica Villagomez contributed.</i></p></div> <div data-type="text"> <div> <p class="" data-item-id="depth_scroll_bottom" data-item-number="bottom" data-item-type="depthscroll"> <i>dyjackson@chicagotribune.com</i></p>   </div></div> </div>  </div>     </section><section id="right-rail">      </section></main> </article>
