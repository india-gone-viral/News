<p>The Centre Thursday told the Supreme Court that though hospitals across the country are responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities, the final responsibility lies with the healthcare workers to protect themselves from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/">Covid-19</a>. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told the top court that the onus is on the health care workers to adequately train themselves and take all required measures to preventing the infection which not only include Covid but other diseases as well.</p>
<p>A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M R Shah allowed petitioner Dr. Arushi Jain’s counsels advocate Mithu Jain and Arjun Syal to file the rejoinder affidavit to Centre’s reply within a week and posted the matter for June 12.</p>
<h2>Maharashtra govt allows inter-district movement in MMR</h2>
<p>The Maharashtra government Thursday allowed inter-district movement of people within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

<p>The nationwide lockdown, in an attempt to contain the coronavirus pandemic, has decimated the economy and exposed us to the “worst of both worlds”, industrialist and Managing Director of Bajaj Auto Rajiv Bajaj said during a conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the economic fallout of the shutdown.</p>

<p>“But you have definitely decimated the economy. You flattened the wrong curve. It is not the infection curve, it is the GDP curve. This is what we have ended (up) with, the worst of both worlds,” he said.</p>
<p>The industrialist also called the lockdown “draconian” and said such a situation was not even called for during the World War. “The way India has been locked down is a draconian lockdown. This kind of lockdown, I’m not hearing about from anywhere else,” he said.</p>
