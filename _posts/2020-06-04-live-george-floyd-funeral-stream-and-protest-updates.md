His neck was pinned beneath the knee of a white police officer for nearly nine minutes, including after Mr. Floyd fell unresponsive.<span>  </span></p><p>The large crowds — both at the protests in recent days and expected at the memorial — reflect the deep anguish and anger that has seized the nation at a pivotal moment, overshadowing social distancing policies for a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 107,000 people and left millions unemployed. </p><p>In recent days, tens of thousands of protesters have gathered shoulder-to-shoulder in America’s streets, saying the names of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html" title="">being chased by three white men</a> in suburban Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, a black medical worker who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html" title="">shot by the police at her home</a> in Louisville, Ky. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The demonstrations continued on Thursday, as suspects in the cases of both Mr. Floyd and Mr. Arbery faced court hearings. In the Arbery case, an investigator testified that one of the three defendants heard another defendant use a racist slur after the shooting.</p><p>In Atlanta, near the birth home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and across the street from the civil rights icon’s final resting place, hundreds of Black Lives Matter advocates bowed their heads in prayer. “Our nation was conceived in liberty, founded in protest,” the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who helms the same pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church that Dr. King held decades prior. “Without protest, we would never be able to expand the meaning of liberty.”</p><p>The Minneapolis service, to be led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, comes a day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/george-floyd-officers-charged.html" title="">enhanced charges were announced</a> against the police officer who wedged his knee onto Mr. Floyd’s neck and new charges against three other officers who participated in the arrest. All have been fired.</p><p>Among those planning to attend the memorial service is Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 when a New York police officer placed him in a fatal chokehold. His last words, “I can’t breathe” — echoed last month by Mr. Floyd — galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement.</p></div></div><div><p>“It just feels like I’m coming to my son’s funeral again,” Ms. Carr said on Wednesday.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="">Murkowski backs criticism of Trump’s leadership.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/world/04unrest-briefing-troops/merlin_173163168_cb7cd38c-79cb-417d-bb4c-0e6936f7d215-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Protesters outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.</span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Thursday became the first Republican senator to say she was considering not voting for President Trump, as she endorsed scathing criticism of the president by James Mattis, the former defense secretary.</p><p>Ms. Murkowski said the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/jim-mattis-trump-protests.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage" title="">critique by Mr. Mattis</a> on Wednesday, in which he said that Mr. Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead, was overdue and might be a tipping point that would cause Republicans to air concerns about the president that they had only spoken about privately.</p><p>Some Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/trump-republicans-protesters.html" title="">have found fault with the president’s</a> handling of the unrest convulsing the nation, but Ms. Murkowski was the most explicit so far in her support for the comments by Mr. Mattis, a former four-star Marine Corps general.</p><p>“I was really thankful,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I thought General Mattis’s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.”</p><p>Ms. Murkowski, one of the few Republicans in Congress who has been willing to break publicly with Mr. Trump, added that when she saw the Mattis statement, “I felt like perhaps we’re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally, and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up.”</p><p>Asked whether she could still support Mr. Trump in the coming election, Ms. Murkowski said: “I am struggling with it. I have struggled with it for a long time.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In his statement, Mr. Mattis said: “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try.<span>  </span>Instead he tries to divide us.

We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.”</p><p>“When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,” Mr. Mattis wrote. “Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens — much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander in chief, with military leadership standing alongside.”</p><p>The statement came hours after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/esper-milley-trump-protest.html" title="">current defense secretary, Mark T.

We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act. Well, I did know that we were going to the church. I was not aware of a photo-op — was happening. Of course, the president drags a large press pool along with him. Look, I do everything I can to try stay apolitical, and to try and stay out of situations that may appear political. National Guard forces did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas into the crowd as reported. Second, guardsmen were instructed to wear helmets and personal protective equipment for their own protection, not to serve as some form of intimidation. Third, military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were wearing field uniforms because that is appropriate uniform when working in a command center and meeting with troops in the streets. Fourth, it wasn’t until yesterday afternoon that we determined it was a National Guard helicopter that hovered low over a city block in D.C. Within an hour or so of learning of this, I directed the secretary of the Army to conduct an inquiry to determine what happened and why. And to report back to me.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img alt="Video player loading" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/03/us/03unrest-briefing-esper/merlin_173090655_82752001-51d4-414d-9e6d-44521e05cb83-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg"></img></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span>In remarks at odds with President Trump’s statements, Defense Secretary Mark T.

Security footage, witness videos and official documents show how a series of actions by officers turned fatal. (This video contains scenes of graphic violence.)</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>It’s a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuffed Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaint filed against Chauvin, the officer who’s later arrested, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaint, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses began filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest, and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaint against Chauvin, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin’s kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for a total of 8 minutes and 46 seconds, according to the complaint filed against him. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Floyd’s preliminary autopsy report, cited in the complaint against Chauvin, found that the combined effects of being restrained by the police and underlying heart disease likely contributed to his death. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter. But for many, none of this has been enough, and outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img alt="Video player loading" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/27/autossell/flyod-site-1-white-box/flyod-site-1-white-box-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"></img></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span>The Times has reconstructed the death of George Floyd on May 25.
