  </section><section data-context="{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}" id="cb-d2d09bc4442b38436339a3bb58a3e072"><p>Patrik tells us he and his hubby, <strong>Pol Atteu</strong>, had just restocked the entire store before Saturday night's violence, as they geared up for a big reopening. The store had been shuttered for months due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
