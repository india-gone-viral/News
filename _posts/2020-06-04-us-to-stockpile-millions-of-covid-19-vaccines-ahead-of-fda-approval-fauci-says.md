<p>Pharmaceutical companies are preparing to test their coronavirus vaccines on tens of thousands of people this summer.</p><p>The fast-moving process has garnered an optimistic outlook from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said on Tuesday that the US could have hundreds of millions of approved vaccines by 2021.</p><p>Moderna will begin giving its COVID-19 vaccine to 30,000 people in the first week of July, Fauci <a data-analytics-module="body_link" href="http://ja.ma/fauci62">told</a> JAMA editor Howard Bauchner in a livestreamed conversation. That's phase three of the clinical-development process — the final trial stage before a vaccine can gain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>In the meantime, Fauci said, the US will begin mass-producing the vaccines so it can distribute them once they gain FDA approval.</p><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="This May 4, 2020 photo from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the first patient enrolled in Pfizer's COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine clinical trial at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, receives an injection.

</figure></p><p>"We're going to start manufacturing doses of the vaccines way before we even know that the vaccine works," Fauci said. "We may know whether it's efficacious or not by maybe November, December. Which means that by that time, we hopefully would have close to 100 million doses. And by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple of hundred million doses."</p>



<p>Fauci added that he was involved in at least four other vaccine trials that will start throughout the summer.</p><p>Among all these efforts, he's "cautiously optimistic" that one will produce an effective vaccine that can be distributed to the public.</p><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="coronavirus vaccine trial mrna covid 19" data-content-type="image/jpeg" data-srcs="{"https://i.insider.com/5ed7dfc2988ee31772558479":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","aspectRatioW":4,"aspectRatioH":3}}" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></img>

<h2>Lingering questions about immunity and vaccines</h2><p>Researchers are still missing two key pieces of information about immunity to the coronavirus: whether everybody who gets infected develops immunity, and how long that protection lasts.</p><p><figure data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" data-type="img"><p><img alt="FILE - In this Wednesday, May 20, 2020 file photo, a health worker takes a blood sample for a COVID-19 antibody test in Los Angeles.

</figure></p><p>"I have examples of people who were clearly infected, who are antibody-negative," Fauci said, adding that those people likely have antibody counts too low for the test to detect. It's unclear if such low antibody levels are enough to protect someone from reinfection. Other recovered patients, meanwhile, show high antibody counts.</p><p>"It isn't a uniformly robust antibody response," Fauci added.</p><p>That could mean that a vaccine might not produce high levels of antibodies in some people.</p>



<p>For those who do gain immunity from a vaccine, it's also unclear how long that protection would last. Other coronaviruses — the kind that cause common cold — produce immunity that lasts less than a year, and in some cases just a few months.</p><p>"It may be completely different with this coronavirus," Fauci said. "We don't know."</p><section><p><svg aria-labelledby="title desc" height="50" role="img" space="preserve" style="enable-background:new 0 0 50 50;" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 50 50" width="50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title id="title">Loading</title><desc id="desc">Something is loading.</desc><path d="M43.935,25.145c0-10.318-8.364-18.683-18.683-18.683c-10.318,0-18.683,8.365-18.683,18.683h4.068c0-8.071,6.543-14.615,14.615-14.615c8.072,0,14.615,6.543,14.615,14.615H43.935z" fill="#111"><animatetransform attributename="transform" attributetype="xml" dur="0.6s" from="0 25 25" repeatcount="indefinite" to="360 25 25" type="rotate"></animatetransform></path></svg></p>
