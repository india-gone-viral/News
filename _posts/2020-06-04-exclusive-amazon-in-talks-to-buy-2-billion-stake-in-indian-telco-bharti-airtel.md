The broader NSE Nifty 50 index <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.NSEI">.NSEI</a> closed down 0.32%. </p><h3>U.S. TECH INTEREST </h3><p>The discussions between Amazon and Bharti underscore the attraction of India’s digital economy for U.S. tech giants. </p><p>Over the past six weeks, Jio, the digital arm of Reliance Industries (<span id="”symbol_RELI.NS_3”"><a href="//www.reuters.com/companies/RELI.NS">RELI.NS</a></span>) raised $10 billion from global investors including Facebook (<span id="”symbol_FB.O_4”"><a href="//www.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a></span>) as it seeks to establish itself as a one-stop digital commerce platform. </p><p>Alphabet Inc’s (<span id="”symbol_GOOGL.O_5”"><a href="//www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O">GOOGL.O</a></span>) Google is also exploring an investment in Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between Britain’s Vodafone Group Plc (<span id="”symbol_VOD.L_6”"><a href="//www.reuters.com/companies/VOD.L">VOD.L</a></span>) and India’s Idea Cellular, the Financial Times reported last week. </p><p>Vodafone Idea is the second-largest telecoms company in India, where the coronavirus lockdown has led to a surge in demand for online shopping, entertainment and data.  </p><p>Amazon counts India as a crucial growth market where it has committed $6.5 billion in investments mainly toward expanding its e-commerce footprint. </p><p>The Seattle-based company has also expanded its digital offerings in India via its voice-activated speakers, video streaming and cloud storage, as it seeks to tap a rising number of internet and smartphone users in the country of 1.3 billion people. </p><p>A deal with Bharti could help Amazon expand offerings via its smart speakers and also boost its cloud business as access to Bharti’s vast telecom fibre network could help Amazon lower costs. Reliance’s Jio has already partnered with Microsoft for use of its Azure cloud platform. </p><div><p>Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi and Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal Editing by Carmel Crimmins</p></div></div></div></div>
