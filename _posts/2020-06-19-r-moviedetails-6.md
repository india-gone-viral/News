Even though Snape is working for the Order, Sirius still treats him the same as adults.</p><p>Sirius treat Harry like James. Harry is an orphan raised in an abusive household for most of his life and latches on to one of the first adult figures that shows a modicum of care for him. But Sirius just sees James. Harry is 13-15 when he knows Sirius. He's a child. And Sirius doesn't seem to understand that at all.</p><p>Sirius is the "cool uncle" you think is awesome as a kid. Then you grow up and realize that he's actually a washed up has-been jock that's past his prime and never outgrew being a teenage bully, and what you thought was cool as a kid is really just sad for a grown man.</p></div></div><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/hbsmq4/in_harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban/" class="button purchase" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read More</a></br> Flip this article: </br><a data-flip-widget="shareflip" href="https://flipboard.com"><img src="https://cdn.flipboard.com/badges/flipboard_mrsw.png" /></a><script src="https://cdn.flipboard.com/web/buttons/js/flbuttons.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
