  <p id="MKrsyo">In recent days it has been reported that Sergio Roberto has been interested in a move to <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/epl/teams/manchester-city">Manchester City</a>. The <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/la-liga/teams/barcelona">Barcelona</a> man has been linked with a move to City because of the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/bundesliga/players/149762/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> connection. </p>
<p id="wMBqYS">According to a report from <em>Mundo Deportivo</em>, Roberto would only leave Barcelona for a club managed by Pep Guardiola. There have been chances in the past for Roberto to move elsewhere for more playing time, but he’s declined to leave the Camp Nou. </p>
<p id="wS2tYY">There haven’t been any reported moves from City that are official. This is an interesting move to watch. Frankly, I don’t see a world wherein Roberto gets a plethora of more playing time in the long term at City. But a reunion with Guardiola might be worth the change for the Spaniard. </p>
