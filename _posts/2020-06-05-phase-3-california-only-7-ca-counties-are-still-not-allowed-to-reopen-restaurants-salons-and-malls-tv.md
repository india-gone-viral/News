<div><section><div><p>SAN FRANCISCO  (KGO) -- Exactly what's open and what's not in California really depends on which county you find yourself in. While dine-in restaurant service has been up and running for weeks in Butte and El Dorado counties, curbside retail pick-up just at the end of May in Santa Clara County.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/when-will-we-see-a-2nd-wave-of-covid-19-cases/6217407/">When will we see a second wave of COVID-19 cases?</a></b></p><p>Why the staggered response? It's because Gov. Gavin Newsom is allowing for local variance when it comes to how quickly (or slowly) counties want to reopen their economies.</p><p>Some sectors are allowed to reopen (with modifications) everywhere in the state, as long as the county gives the green light. Those sectors include retail (for curbside pickup), manufacturing, logistics, childcare facilities, offices where people can't telework, car washes, pet groomers, landscapers and outdoor museums.</p><p>However, if a county wants to open hair salons, barbershops, schools, dine-in restaurants or shopping malls, they have to go through an attestation process, in which they certify the spread of COVID-19 is under control locally.</p><p><b>ENTERING PHASE 3: <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/watch-live-ca-enters-phase-3-of-reopening-newsom-announces/6212605/">California moves into Phase 3 of reopening with hair salons, barbershops, Gov. Newsom announces</a></b></p><p>As of Thursday, all but 7 of California's 58 counties have completed that process. The only counties not allowed to move into Stage 2.5 and 3 are Alameda, Contra Costa, Imperial, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.</p><p><i>(Note: We've been updating this story as more counties achieve attestation.)</i></p><p>All but one of the counties where stricter measures must remain in place are in the Bay Area.</p><p>Last week, San Francisco <a href="https://abc7news.com/sf-mask-order-reopening-plan-san-francisco-stay-at-home/6217318/">Mayor London Breed laid out the city's detailed plan to reopen its economy</a>. Dine-in restaurants, hair salons and barbershops aren't scheduled to reopen until July 13. Schools are slated to reopen in August.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/ca-moving-too-quickly-to-reopen-churches-and-hair-salons-dr-cody-says/6214930/">'If we don't pause to see the impact, we're blind': Bay Area expert's warning on CA reopening here</a></b></p><p>On the topic of broader reopening, Santa Clara County Public Health Director Sara Cody <a href="https://abc7news.com/dr-sara-cody-santa-clara-county-reopening-covid-19-updates-cases/6176971/">said last month</a>, "We're not there yet."</p><p>"The conditions really haven't changed in our county," she said.
